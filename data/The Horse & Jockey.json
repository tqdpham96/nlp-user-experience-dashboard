Pork cooked in this style comes with an element of fat which is where the flavour comes from. You could have had a piece from the converted belly pork which can be very fatty.\nAs for fun you have to bring that with you.  We find that the big roast is a great excuse for family and friends to get together and usually there is a bit of serendipity and old friends can be bumped into.",

Your review and comments don't take this into account, so you are bound to score us poorly in comparison! I can see you were tech savvy enough to book online, so our menu was available to you before you came, if you’d care to look.\n\nWe serve a simple yet fairly fresh menu of 10 main courses, mostly pub classics, all under £10, alongside a great selection of hot and cold sandwiches too. Hardly a small menu especially if you’d taken into account that my wife makes much from scratch including ...\nSoup\nSteak and ale pie including the pastry\nLasagna (both traditional and vegetarian)\nChili con carne (traditional and veg)\nAll mash and gravy\nThe best apple crumble.\n\nWhere we don't make it ourselves, we source the produce from our friends at The Cheshire Butcher and Farmshop including...\nProtein - chicken, ham, bacon, beef, steak, mince,\nDairy - eggs, butter, milk, cheese, cream\nFruit and Veg - potatoes, apples, lemons,\nOther - pate, pork pies, ice cream, chutneys.\n\nWe’d love to have you back but don't be so harsh next time. Give us another try when you can't be bothered to cook but fancy a home cooked meal.\n\nGive Ann & Jeremy our best!",
