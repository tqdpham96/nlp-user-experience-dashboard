The village looked beautiful with all the trees lit up for Christmas and lots of restaurants and quirky style shops to spend your time in.\nAt the hotel we were checked in by a pleasant gentleman who gave us all the information needed for the pub food and closing  times and hotel details. The room was quite small but big enough to fit a super king size bed. It was clean and warm and had an extremely\npowerful shower. We dined in the restaurant later in the evening but be sure to order by 8.45 before the kitchen closes. The service and food was good if not a little expensive and plenty options available for your choice of tipple with a pint of Madre knocking on £6.50-ish. The breakfast was hot, tasty and ideal for a big appetite, its very big!  The seating/dining area has little rooms dotted about all with chunky beams and character. All in all we had a lovely stay and if in the area again we would definitely stay here again.\n(A thank you to the guy at the end of the night who took a picture of us in the grotto)",

The waitress service was good until the bill came when I asked to use Tesco vouchers. The waitress obviously sighed and said she would have to cancel the bill. That took a couple of seconds and she proceeded to scan my vouchers which again, in the empty restaurant, took a matter of seconds. I asked how much had I paid and she sighed again and told me in a negative tone how much etc. I suspect that her problem was that she did not expect a tip as surely it could not be the \"workload\" as the place was empty. I settled up the balance and did not tip. It is a long time since I haven't given the customary 10% whether by card or cash. I am still going to give her a tip albeit belated. My tip is not a monetary one but some advice. Be polite and don't let the restaurant down.",

We were there for the trampoline competition at Kings School Macclesfield the following day.\n\nWhat can i say, except absolutely fantastic! A really pleasant setting, very relaxed atmosphere inside the place - just what i like.\n\nThe food was fantastic, absolutely fantastic. It was served nice and hot, on time and with a smile and chat from all the waiting staff who dealt with us.\n\nWe arrived 20 mins early for our booking and fully expected to be told to wait and come back, but no, the check in lady offered us to go to the bar and have drink before our table opened up, this was very welcome considering i'd driven for nearly 2 hours to get there.\n\nour table opened up and the experience just kept getting better and better. we were waited on by 3 different people, each was as attentive/polite and courteous as the next.\n\nWe had a starter to share, 2 main adult meals, 2 kids meals + puddings, + 4 kids drinks and 2 alcohol drinks - total bill £59.60 (absolutely fantastic value)\n\n5/5* for the food\n5/5* for the staff\n5/5* for the pub itself\n5/5* for the ample free parking\n\nIf we are in Macclesfield any time in the future, we will be sure to come here again.",

From the moment I first checked in, I was made to feel at home by the amazing staff led by Gill and Hannah. The hotel is situated in the very affluent area of Alderley Edge which has many excellent restaurants, but I very rarely feel the need to drift away from the excellent and very comprehensive menu at the De Trafford. The pub itself has a warm and friendly atmosphere with plenty of choice of drinks although I have my usual tipple which is always efficiently topped up 😀😀 and as I travel alone there is always a friendly face to strike up a conversation with either the fantastic staff or the friendly customers. During Covid they all worked so hard to  create an extremely clean and safe environment. Unfortunately I don’t have the need to commute for work as regularly as I did pre Covid but when I do commute I have no hesitation in booking into the De Trafford where I always get a amazing welcome from whom some have become fantastic friends. The hotel is in a perfect location for business being close to Manchester and the airport and also for leisure as a great place to explore the delights of Cheshire and the Peak District. I would certainly recommend this hotel as a great place to stay. In fact I will be visiting next week and can’t wait to be back there 😊😊",

(See photo) in my opinion this is just a very stranged mixed dish, the Crumpet itself wasn't overly hot and the Mustard Stick just made it look weird.... It was ok to eat but nothing to write home about. The chips were hot, the Caramalised Onion, Tomoto, Feta Tart was freezing - I am assuming Tarts are served this way but it would have been 100 times better if it had been hot or even Luke warm.\n\nMy Dad had Cod and chips and he said it was very hot and it was a nice portion size.\n\nFor dessert we had Bakewell Tart and Custard which was BEAUTIFUL!! The best part of the whole visit. My Dad had Millionaire Cheesecake and Ice cream which he also enjoyed.\n\nThe member of staff was very nice, she read out all of the ice cream options as well and she was very pleasant.\n\nThe place itself is nice, we felt like it was very clean and there were lots of Hand Sanitiser Stations etc. The toilets were also very clean!\n\nWould come back again but I do wish there were more Vegetarian options or better Starters 😄",

All four of us were very impressed by the standards maintained at this three star establishment. We could not fault the attitude, friendliness and willingness to please displayed by all the staff. We had two breakfasts and one evening meal in the restaurant, which would put many more expensive hotels to shame.. Beds are comfortable with spotless white linen, the televisions are brand new, large and boast all Freeview channels. In the bathroom are soft snow white towels and continuous hot water. Now obviously if all was perfect it would have a higher rating but if you want cheap and cheerful and excellent value De Trafford takes some beating. For me some improvements that would have little cost would be, a mirror over the dressing table, shelving in the bathroom to put toiletries on and more storage space for non-hanging clothing. A display of local tourist attractions would also be appreciated. Most lasting impression though was of a happy weekend being well cared for by this excellent team of staff.",

White blinds and shower curtains looks pristine and brand new. The light bulbs are quiet dull and yellow which makes it hard to get ready in winter as it goes dark at 4pm but location is the best in the area. Right in the heart of the village high street. Bargain at the price I paid and I booked last minute. Reception staff said I might have got it even cheaper if I'd have booked in advance. Would definitely recommend. My only regret is I didn't get chance to dine in the pub. The food looked amazing",
