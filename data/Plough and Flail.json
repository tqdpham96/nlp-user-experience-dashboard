The main course states it has mash potatoes, roast potatoes, swede, etc etc.  The mash was one teaspoon, the swede one teaspoon, etc. The greens were absolutely ice cold, so were the parsnips, roast potatoes in the middle and the whole plate in general. I complained twice and when the waiter was asked by another member of staff what was wrong he replied, ‘nothing, I do not see why she is complaining’. TOUCH THE POTATOES AND VEGETABLES. Then he comes out and the beef is cold and so is the rest of the food. The manager could not even come and apologise. They did not charge for the desserts and coffee but guess what….the person that complained did not have dessert or coffee. The staff were rushed off their feet though it was not busy at all. I supposed that should have given us an indication because Sunday Lunch places are hard to find on the spot. Even when I asked for the left overs to be packed so I could give it to the dog, there was no reaction. Never going back.",

She said she would be back to take our order for drinks, after ten mins I had to go to the bar and order them ok they were busy I thought. The food arrived quite some time later delivered by a young man, I asked about the drinks \"I'll go and hecheck sir\"\nHe came back apologised as the drinks order had been mislaid and he took our drinks order again my wife had ordered a prosecco which arrived in a small bottle (when did the d-i-y culture bestart).\nThe food was just about warm enough to eat, again I thought they're very busy, the man on the next table had to re-order his drinks three times and he wasn't happy ! By this time I was beginning not to make excuses for the poor service now I was realising that the staff (all youngsters) had not had appropriate training. When i wanted to pay, a young man asked what table we were on and after having told him three times he tried a contactless payment for a bill of £35+  I had to tell him that he needed to insert my card into machine to make a payment over £30. Before leaving I wanted to make my feelings known to management but was told that the manager was away and that Pedro was available but he was not to be found, the person I spoke to apologised and said most of the problems were caused by management ..",

The table given was sticky since it had not been cleaned properly. There was dropped food under the table. Service was inattentive and sloppy. I had to leave the table to get drinks. The response was..“ I don’t usually serve drinks.”When the drinks arrived, designer gins were in wine glasses. No children’s menu offered. The food was tasty and enjoyable. The pub was suffering from a shortage of trained staff. We have eaten here many times and were surprised at the fall in standards. It was a poor and regrettable experience which will not be repeated in our presence.",

We arrived at 12:30 without an appointment and the Jose Lourenco - the General Manager - found us a table despite a busy lunchtime. We ordered the Haddock and Chips which arrived amazingly quickly. The chips were rustic, twice-cooked and home made and the Haddock as beuatifully fresh with the thinnest, crispiest, tastiest batter I have tasted for a long time.  The Plough is a bit out of the way but it is well worth the journey. We will be returning for more.",
