We had a starter (calamari), main (beef) and desert (sticky toffee pudding).\n\nWe arrived and were immediately pleasantly surprised by how attentive the service was. The table staff came straight to our table and took orders for drinks. We ordered the calamari and chipolatas  for our starter and it was very good. A great start.\n\nIt was all downhill from there. The roast was made up of a slither of fatty beef, a pile of tasteless mash, 3 tiny roasties that were so soggy they may as well have been even more mash, another pile of mashed swede (yes there was a theme to the plate) and some average greens. The texture of this meal could be summed up in one word - Mushy. Honestly the worst roast I’ve ever had at a restaurant.\n\nFor dessert we had sticky toffee pudding. There was no toffee and nothing sticky about it . It was just a dry square of something that may once have been a pudding.\n\nAlso - for the bar staff, please note, when someone orders a shandy, you shouldn’t charge them for a full pint AND a “dash of lemonade” at an additional £1.10. Shandy is not supposed to be more expensive than a pint of lager\n\nThe service was great from table staff and the environment was nice enough but otherwise awful\n\nWhat a let down.",

Nobody asked us were enjoying our meal at any point so when a young man came to collect our plates,(still no question \"did you enjoy your meal\") I said to him the food was not hot ,plates cold and serving dish cold,he just put his head down and said,\"oh ok\".

The little side of pork crackling was a pleasure for the tastebuds, all topped of with a beautiful  beef dripping gravy. 100%recommended",

You always get a warm, friendly and professional welcome. My meal was delicious as well, but the CUSTOMER CARE on this visit was EXCEPTIONAL.\n\nTHANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO WORKS THERE X\n\nJoe P",

Food was lovely however we ordered a second round of drinks which never turned up. The chicken wings are served on a small plate which doesn't work so well. Whilst the staff are all very busy and are working very hard, somehow it just doesn't seem to work. The bar is small and service is v slow. To pay the bill, I had to queue for awhile. Unfortunately based on the experience, not somewhere we would go back to - just based on the speed and reliability of service. I do reiterate that the staff are all v nice and clearly working their socks off.",

Hugely disappointing! Also took ages although not busy as a Monday late afternoon. Was pleased someone took my order for drink was I had 3 dogs that was really helpful as nice.\n\nShame not indoor dog friendly as it was freezing outside and fire not well lite be better if there were outside heaters.\n\nWill return but sadly will never order food again.\n\nReally needs a good chef and quality ingredients 👌",

They do most of the roast dishes in two portion sizes which is great as I’m not a big eater but my husband is.  The beef was very tender; not quite as rare as I’d like but very tasty.  Served with mashed and roast potatoes, mashed swede, mixed green veg, huge Yorkshire pudding (half a pudding on small plate) and gravy.  It was piping hot.  We finished with sticky toffee pudding and chocolate brownie.  We didn’t need to eat again that day.  The beer offering isn’t massive but they do have a couple of local beers on draught.  Would definitely recommend.",

When I asked if I could have more roast potatoes than boiled I was told I could have all roast.  I would recommend to the chef that he roasts the lamb in loads of bay leaves and/ or rosemary. By doing that you get a lot more depth of flavour. It can also enhance the flavour of the gravy. If I was the owner of the Ship I woul grow my own herbs outside the pub. Woody herbs like that can look nice and last all year round. One other thing is the person who brought out the Lamb did not tell us the serving dish was too hot to touch. Would recommend to staff that they remember to tell people. Anyway thanks to all for a very enjoyable lunch!",

                "text": "We went to the Ship last Friday afternoon. I had booked a table and checked that there was suitable disabled access. I was told to park on the car park and look for a door marked Private. No Access. Getting across the car park was a nightmare as the potholes are craters, in fact I got stuck and had to reverse out of a hole as I couldn't go forward. I located the  door but when I opened it the first thing I saw was a massive deep hole in the ground. There was not room to push a wheelchair past it so this entrance was a no no. We went round to the front of the building and I tried to push the wheelchair through the paved area up to the front door. I was having so much trouble that two young' well built guys got up from their table and came to help me. They were having trouble so a third customer came to help.The 3 of them managed it but you can imagine how difficult it was to take 3 strong men to access the building. I found a waiter and told him we had booked a table on the patio. He said we would not be able to get out at the back because of steps. Fortunately my husband can walk a few steps and there was a handrail so he was able to get down them and I carried the wheelchair down.After we had finished eating I went to look for the toilets. There is no disabled toilet and the facilities are all up a steep flight of stairs which I found difficult and quite scary. Leaving the premises we decided the best bet was to attempt to get out at the rear by going up to the hole in the ground then my husband would stand up and hold onto the wall. I would then take the wheelchair back down the passageway, up the steps,through the pub and outside across the front,round the back, across the car park and pick him up by the hole. As we were starting this the waiter appeared and came down the passageway with us. He held onto my husband and manoevered him past the hole so I could get the wheelchair past him and pick him up again.The waiter was as helpful as he could be but I should not have been told that the premises are suitable for disabled so if you have any disability don\"t visit this pub. It was closed for refurbishment about 7 years ago but clearly does not conform to present regulations.",

We waited over an hour for three starters, and when we complained, the manager was far from helpful and did not seem to care, simply saying there was nothing she could do. She said social distancing was the reason for the delay, which if it was the case, should have been mentioned upon ordering. Rather, it seemed they had filled more tables than they could cope with and were struggling to keep up. Had we not had to pay upon ordering we would have left after the hour wait. When the food did arrive, it was underwhelming at best and unpleasant in parts. I could have cooked it better myself.  A great shame for what could be a lovely little pub.",

We had to sort it out ourselves.  3 people at our table got their main course as the rest of us were finishing....not ideal. Trying to get a dessert menu was almost impossible! Having said all this the food was excellent but I do think they need more staff as having to wait so long for food is not acceptable.",

Manager had a disgraceful attitude towards us as paying customers and even request we vacate our table before we had sat down (Which we had a half an hour wait for) at a specified time. The food on a turkey bap meal supposed contained 'traditional trimmings' - Which amounted to a pot of gravy and a couple of potatoes. The food caused multiple members of our party gastric distress. The staff acted rude to their own staff members, one young boy was basically running the entire front of house by himself, and none of the staff acted politely to him (saying please and thank you) until one of our party members complained under their breath. All in all that manager's attitude was truly shocking and disgraceful and how she expects to keep customers returning is a mystery to me. There are plenty of other excellent restaurants that are viable alternatives to this restaurant nearby.",

My wife had the butternut squash tortellini, which she said was good, but not great. It wasn't packing much flavour (other than the pesto sauce), and was not very hot. I had a pork culet special. The pork was a little overcooked, but it was tasty.  The accompanying cauliflower cheese was fabulous. Overall, a decent feed but fell short on execution.",

We opted for the roast beef with trimmings, even in the heat, wow, one of the best pub meals I've ever had. The meat was tender and pink as the menu said, the Yorkshire pudding crisp yet soft in the middle (just like my mum's) the vegetables cooked perfectly. We will be visiting again, just to go to the pub.👍",

Fast friendly service and a pleasant atmosphere. Good range of beers on offer. The whole family enjoyed themselves. Will visit again next time we are up this way.",

The Barmaid/ manager is the most unprofessional barmaid I've ever encountered, maybe she should get a job at the Women's prison over the road? I hope they go bust so someone with a modicum of customer care takes over.\nWe go on a weekly basis due to its convenient location but not going ever again after Saturday: we went at 5pm on Saturday 24th for a hard earned pint. After being ignored at the bar for a couple of minutes by the three people behind the bar, the aforementioned barmaid barked at me that they weren't serving for half an hour because they \"had been busy\". I think this is what she said, it was snarled in such a vicious and despicable way that the local stood next to me had to interpret. I've never seen such appalling \"service\" (if you can call it that as we were not actually served at all) ever in any customer service environment, ever. Goodbye Ship Inn, I can't see you staying open much longer at this rate.\nAvoid!",
