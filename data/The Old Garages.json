An example of a brunch I have purchased today was smoked salmon, focaccia, rocket and wedge of lemon and an iced coffee - it was lovely! At £11, I thought it was completely worth it!

We asked for water about 3 times and when we were given it we were given 7 glasses and were told that would have to do for the 8 of us. The staff were obviously not trained in\nhospitality at all.

The young waitress who took your order was only on her second day of taking orders and the egg on top of the chicken was a simple error on our part for which we apologised.  I have to say that only one tart was returned and I did try it - you were offered a replacement and decided not to take us up on it. With reference to all the other meals, your party clearly enjoyed them as the plates were clear. You asked for tap water and we obliged - half of which you didn't drink. All businesses are on a water meter so we see it as very wasteful when requests for tap water are fulfilled by our team and then are subsequently not drank by the customer. We do also offer a water fountain for folks that are super thirsty.\n\nKind regards\nTØG",

My daughter was having a fairly epic toddler moment and Lucy, the waitress, could see I was flustered having to negotiate the stairs with a baby and a squirming toddler. After asking my permission, she instantly scooped up my toddler and expertly calmed her down whilst I paid up and even helped me get her into the pram too and out of the door. The young man behind the counter also couldn’t do more to help and offered to pour my daughter’s left over juice (the source of her irrational meltdown 😅) into a take out cup. Lucy’s kindness and understanding clearly made a huge impression on my daughter as she has kept mentioning her for the rest of the day. In short- great coffee, great food and most definitely child friendly!",

To say a 'few tongue in cheek' words and hit our team with a 1 star review is appaling to say the least. Your feedback is neither funny nor constructive and therefore pointless. Our pergola is full of flowers with a lovely hedge on one side and grass too. Great thought and consideration is put into everything we do and to have you try and bring our Google rating down through what can only be considered as a childish remark is beyond belief. You may have missed the last year, maybe you were asleep in Nursery, but for clarity, because of the pandemic the hospitality industry has been one of the hardest hit and therefore your comments are misplaced and not welcome. Please try and keep criticism both constructive and positive when you do your next review 👍",

I've been a few times before and I could never quite make up my mind about the place, it's a very small venue with most of the seating on the raised balcony so perhaps not the best place if you have trouble negotiating stairs.  It's also expensive when compared to other cafes in the area and to me expensive can mean 'good' in a comforting sort of way that means you are going to get a great experience in both service and food.  But, personally I can't quite help but feel this has never been the case with the Old Garages.  On this occasion I went with a colleague and we ordered a tea, an Americano, Pastrami sandwich and baked eggs. The drinks arrived which were drunk in fifteen minutes.  OK, one thinks the food will follow shortly but after 30 minutes you start to wonder if they've missed your order somehow.  So next  comes that really awful part where you have to go and find someone and apologetically ask if they know when your food will be coming.  When told it takes 30 minutes to bake the eggs one wonders whether that might have been a useful bit of information to give in advance to a customer when ordering such food?  So forty minutes in and the food finally arrives.  Was it any good?  Would it make up for the long wait?  Wish I could say yes but mine was served in a small ceramic bowl that was heated to the temperature of the sun and sadly  was mostly tomato. When going to pay the young assistant seemed to make  a point of distinctly not asking if everything was alright with the meal and just billed me for £23.95.  Without that opening dialogue you just become too embarrassed to say anything.   So, as I said at the beginning, perhaps it was an off day for them, but to me it missed the mark somewhat and on this occasion cost and service hadn't quite gone hand in hand.  Would I return?  Probably not.  Would I recommend it?  Hmmm?  Give it a go, especially if you are not limited to your lunch break.\n\nADDITION;  Having read the reply from Adam at the Old Garages it is important to reiterate two key points.  Firstly, as in my original text, one takes comfort from a  place that is generally priced higher than the local competition since it is usually a guaranteed of a higher quality of service. Secondly, Adam has made the mistake of assuming that my previous visits were positive ones.  I regret to say they were not, but to leave a review without visiting a venue several times beforehand would be deeply unfair to anyone.\n\nAdam kindly asked me to contact him with a view to 'welcoming me back', for which I was more than happy to do.   I duly sent off two emails to the address supplied, included my telephone number and asked him to give me a call (much nicer to speak to people direct don't you think?).  Sadly I have not received a reply to date which is a great shame.",

I am sorry that we missed the mark on your last visit so please email me at hello@theoldgarages.com so that I can garner some more information about your visit and which day it actually was. As for us being on the expensive side, our food and service goes down very well with our core customers. We pride ourselves on using the best ingredients available and this does come at a cost. The service we hope is friendly and informal. For you to have visited several times there must be something about us that you like but you have taken the stance of not giving us a positive review and seem to have waited for us to have an off day and hit us with a bad review - a little unfair. I do apologise however that you had to chase your food and invariably had an overly extended lunch because of the wait on your baked eggs. Ordinarily we do informed customers that this dish takes 20/25 minutes and clearly on this occassion it was a much longer wait. So, please do take the opportunity to email me so that we may welcome you back. Many thanks Adam",

I was unable to eat my food properly as needed to hold baby with one hand and eat with the other.... My baby is unable to go into a highchair as she is too young so was relying on the pram to put her down.\n\nThe food was terrible... I ordered a chicken BLT and was very disappointed that this consisted of two slices of bread, a whole solid piece of chicken breast (semi-sliced... Unseasoned, and dry), a lettuce leaf, one piece of bacon and a couple of tomato slices.. And what seemed like half a jar's worth of mayonnaise. That was it... All for the extortionate price of £9.50. I feel robbed.\n\nI was asked if everything was okay when paying and I did mention that I wasn't happy with the sandwich... I was told that my comments would be passed on to the chef... Not really good enough in my opinion.\n\nThe posh Earl Grey tea was nice though.",

It only comes with two slices of bread as it is a closed sandwich. The chicken being dry, is an issue. We poach our chicken in homemade seasoned stock and leave the customer to add more seasoning should they require it. I will check the conditions under which it was cooked so that this doesn't happen again. It worth noting though that it is a whole chicken breast and we do use heritage tomatoes hence the price point. With regard to the driveway, its not under our ownership and it is as good as it can be. I appreciate it can be a mission to get down. We do however have a secure shelter for buggies (it is monitored by CCTV) and we have some small new born baby cribs on order. I'm really glad that you loved our Loose Leaf Tea. Feel rest assured that I will raise the issue of the chicken breast and we look forward to welcoming you again soon.",

We are more than happy to have children at The Old Garages but we do not accept buggies or prams. We are a smaller establishment that is also a homeware store and simply cannot accommodate them. If we have a policy whereby we choose to implement it when it's busier would simply be unfair to customers as everyone has a different perception of 'busy'. It is therefore necessary to have a blanket 'no buggies' policy. We offer high chairs and a buggy park outside and have witnessed that most buggies have a detachable crib that people come in with should their baby wish to sleep. We find that 90% of the time, everyone is fine with it and I'm sorry that you're not. Thanks again, The Old Garages.",

We made our escape.\n\nA comment about access directed at the owner of this establishment:\nIf you are unlucky enough to have to use a wheelchair; then you want to be as independent as possible. You don't want to have to rely on the others to get about. You certainly don't want to have to wait for someone else to decide to come and help you to get out!\nPlease have a think about these comments",

Our driveway is long and that allows us to have a designated disabled parking bay which unfortunately you must have missed having had to walk from the road. You spotted that the door swings back- this is merely it doing what it was intended to and that is to keep the heat in and the inclement weather out. When designing The Old Garages we put great thought into the disabled lavatories and also making sure that the whole of the downstairs space was easy to navigate round. We made door openings extra wide and we polished the concrete floor in order to assist with wheelchair access. You came on a busy day and our team is trained to be professional and courteous at all times and to criticise them when they were simply offering to help is not really fair. If the day had been quieter then they certainly would have assisted sooner. We all think its great that you loved the food and coffee and hope to see you again soon. Best wishes Adam",

We visited on mothers day with our 2 children age 3 and 5 on viewing the menu we.could see that there were limited breakfast options available and certainly non for our young children which is maybe intentional. We asked 2 waitresses if there might be a chance of an alternative option they could offer the children but we welcomed with an almost appalled face by one waitress who told us in no uncertain circumstances... no! We asked if any chance of a bowl of fruit at least? No fruit. My Wife ordered Eggs Benedict Royale however after no longer than 5 minutes asked if she could change to another dish... you guessed it the answer was NO!! Which we found odd given the Royale took 30 minutes to arrive! Clearly they could have changed the dish.\nThe place lacked any atmosphere with no background music which made for a very staid and conservative feel.\nNot sure what the target market is but isn't us. Shame as could be great, we won't be returning. Sorry guys we're not 'reviewers' but felt compelled to on this occasion.",

We sadly left after a comment was made, and duly charged for the experience. It’s fine to want to be a child free zone, I totally get that, just make it clear/policy.\n\nHowever, don’t let this review put you off. If you feel you can fit in with the cafe’s narrow ‘vision’ then I have absolutely no doubt you’d be most welcome. Enjoy!",
