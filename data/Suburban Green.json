We all ordered the Lamb shwarma which was slightly disappointing. The flat bread was a bit doughy and cold and cold cous cous, made the lamb cold. Mentioned to staff as not sure if this is how it was supposed to be - it was immediately taken away and fresh one brought which was marginally better. Overall food good and service excellent. They also gave a discount on the bill which was appreciated. Would definitely go again",

Unfortunately our most recent visit was completely spoiled when a waiter dropped a place full of food on my partner. A brief apology followed and an offer to get a cloth to help clear up…then another delay before a useless clump of damp paper towels arrived because they didn’t have a cloth (!?). My partner was sat with a spoiled top and we quickly asked for the bill (no gesture of good will as an apology or apology from the manager). To top it off, my partner had asked for a Sauvignon blanc and we’d been charged for the most expensive one too. We probably won’t be back which is a real shame.",

Both Pescatorians we were attracted by the many vegetarian/vegan options compared to other places.\nStand out dish was the bang bang cauliflower with amazing Asian dressing. Creamy garlic mushrooms were very satisfying.\nWe ordered 4 of the tapas dishes each plus a side each. I would recommend only three each max as we we're stuffed by the end.\nAs others have said prices are reasonable as they use very fresh good quality ingredients.\nStaff we're helpful and friendly when we were asking about the different dishes.\nWe would definitely return but order less! 😂",
