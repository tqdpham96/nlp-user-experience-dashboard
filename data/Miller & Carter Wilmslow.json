She snapped to say we hadn’t ordered the ‘experience’ only the cote de boeuf?!\nFor one she didn’t ask and another we then presumed our booking request had been read as she said on arrival ‘a cote de boeuf’ had been held for us?!\nIt all worked out in the end and the food was beautiful and cooked to perfection.\nPlease read any requests on the booking and perhaps if unsure or cannot meet requests the customer could be rung to confirm/decline before arrival?",

Steak inedible due to a thick (unknown at time of cooking thick line of sinew) and mostly completely uncooked - I asked for “medium rare” which is listed as hint of red - no photo as it was too unpleasant to look at. Thin line of cooked meat on the outside and the middle was raw. Staff couldn’t have done more to help though swiftly and offered a new steak but that would have meant my friends would have had to carry on eating and I’d have eaten alone so I refused. No dramas, I’d had enough to eat. Free dessert offered and the steak off the bill. Resolved easily and quickly but we will give Miller and Carter Wilmslow a swerve for a while. 3 other meals were fine. Thanks to the waitress for her attention and help.",

Aimee had said she was coeliac so put us at easy eating here when she’s never had a problem and explained things like how he couldn’t have the chips because of cross contamination with the fryer. We went for the Valentine’s 3 course meal the value for money was insane food portions plenty and both our steaks cooked exactly as we asked. Will definitely hurry back!!",

After you told me I was ridiculous for not allowing the booking, I explained that there would be a wait before anyone could see to you, as I had explained to every  guest that had arrived at our restaurant without a booking.\r\rYou were shown to your table and as it was busy, I had to rush off to continue running the restaurant. When your server did manage to eventually get to your table, they were extremely uncomfortable with how rude you were to them and after asking if your children could stop running around the restaurant – particularly outside out kitchen doors where a potential for injury could occur - you ignored this and did not attempt to return your children to the table. When this was highlighted to you, the response you gave; “we are going to allow our children to run around and trash the restaurant as revenge for your manager” was not acceptable. The reason we asked for your children not to run around our restaurant is to ensure that all our team and guests remain safe and secure whilst enjoying a meal. I did not feel that you respected this and your attitude towards myself and the team here at Miller and Carter Wilmslow was unacceptable and after your server stated they did not feel comfortable serving you after your comments regarding “revenge” I felt it necessary and within my rights as the manager on duty to ask you to leave the restaurant.\r\rI’m sorry that you feel this is unacceptable however; myself and my team here at Miller and Carter have the right to work in an environment where they are treated with nothing but the utmost respect, and any inappropriate behaviour is not tolerated in the business; hence the reason for your party being asked to leave. \r\rRegards,\rJack\rDeputy Manager\rMiller and Carter Wilmlsow",

When asking about the offer, we were told that this didn’t start until the following day because it was a bank holiday.\n\nHad we of known that beforehand, we would’ve gone elsewhere given it’s just after Christmas and the meal then came to over double what we were expecting to pay.\n\nOn top of this, the kitchen was out of a majority of the steak options and half of the sides. So overall, it wasn’t a great experience and I doubt I will be returning as Hawksmoor is far better and worth the money you pay.",

She really went the extra mile to make our meal perfect, including serving the lettuce wedge for my grandfather on a bigger plate and cutting it up for him, as well as letting us out a side exit for a quicker route to the car park.\n\nThe food was beautiful too! I went for a steak well done (which I know chef's would hate me for!) and it was cooked to perfection, I especially enjoyed the beef dripping sauce it came with, I've not had such a good steak in a very long time!\n\nThank you Abby, as well as the rest of the staff for being so accommodating and kind - we really appreciated it!",

When I questioned the server and manager I was told that although all the separate items were available they could not be put together to create the butchers block. The reason given was that they had to reserve all the separate items for future orders!. Being offered no alternatives we had no choice but to order the items individually at a cost of £30 more than it would have been. Food was good as always but disappointed that we were not accommodated better",

We are disappointed to hear that you were not satisfied with your visit. As explained to you on the evening we had to make the decision to remove some items off our menu due to the fact that two of our neighbouring sites had closed temporarily, leaving us being the only site open in the area, which meant we saw an unexpected increase in trade and bookings. Please let me assure you that had this been foreseen, we would've been able to have preempted this situation from occurring, but unfortunately this was not the case in this instance. We do ope that you understand our reasoning behind this and apologise for the upset that this caused you on the evening.\n\nKind Regards,\nRachael and the team.",

One of our steaks was way overcooked and so had to send it back, meaning I ate my food while my partner waited for his.\nAlthough the waitress was very helpful it still wasn’t the experience we have come to expect from miller and Carter restaurants.\nWe were offered free deserts but declined as we were actually quite full.\nMore recently, we decided to give the restaurant another chance. We were given a warm welcome and taken to our table. The restaurant was very quiet which was odd as we were given a table crammed into the corner of a small section which was quite cosy with other guests.\n\nWe both ordered the steak experience which included a salad to start. The lettuce had brown patches which were slightly off putting. A simple task I would think to cut out by the chef.\nThe steaks arrived shortly after, both again were overcooked however the middle sections were a medium which we decided to eat.\nThe onion loaf was hard, difficult to cut and mushy in the middle. We waited at least 10 minutes for the waiter to come and see how our food was but nobody came I therefore had to go to the bar to ask the waiter if we could get two fresh pieces of the onion loaf. Within a few minutes the two onion loaf is arrived which look like they just come out the microwave as we’re still slightly steaming again this look like it was from the same batch as the ones we’ve just been given. I feel like the chef had not cooked this fresh for the day and it instead used the previous day or days batch’s.\n\nWe have frequented a few miller and Carter restaurants within the UK now and this is probably the only location where we have been disappointed with the standard of food. If I’m honest I feel like the chef has been quite lazy, as some of the same issues we had repeated themselves again.\n\nIt’s a shame as the service overall was good however the restaurant is being let down by the standard of food which the chef is overall responsible for.\n\nSadly we won’t be returning to the restaurant in Wilmslow, however we have not given up on the chain completely and will continue to visit miller and Carter restaurants elsewhere.",

They have all delivered consistent perfectly cooked steaks and good service - making it our favourite steak restaurant . However the Wilmslow restaurant has now changed that opinion. The Wilmslow restaurant is not to the same standard as the other M&C . I have visited twice now and on the first visit I had to return my steak as is it was over-cooked and the steak did not look right. The wait staff were very helpful to rectify the situation. On my second visit on Wednesday night, again the steak was slightly over-cooked but ok to eat. The onion slice they came with it however looked old, was rock-hard and inedible. Again the wait staff were helpful. Overall the food is not cooked to the standard of all the other M&C restaurants. I would avoid the Wilmslow chain it is not value for money at all. I won’t be back.",

We chose this restaurant after a terrible visit to their Stockport branch and we were not disappointed!\n\nTwo people in our party were wheelchair users and had accessible vehicles which are quite large as they have gold out wheelchair ramps.  A staff member came out and helped us park these vehicles advising where would be best for us.  So the top class service started before we entered.\n\nFood was excellent and I have an illness which means I eat very slowly.  They were very accommodating and didn’t rush the mains, they allowed me time to finish the starters and not be rushed. (Stockport branch brought the\nMains whilst I was still eating the starters!!).\n\nThis was the first time my uncle and my mum had been to a Miller and Carter although they had heard us talk about it often enough.\n\nMy uncle rated his fillet as “the second best steak he had ever had” (he said the best was one he made and so couldn’t say that was bad 😂.\n\nMy mum loved her meal and understood why we say good things about this venue.\n\nMy son was paralysed a few months ago and so has recently come out of rehabilitation.  I had promised him a steak when he came home and so he was a member of the party.  He had the T-Bone and loved it.\n\nStaff were excellent and Amber even had a bit of banter with my uncle regarding his Guinness which he loved.  Amber was an excellent waitress and very friendly and patient.\n\nOnly slight downside was my wife missed the berries on her dessert that should have been with the dish.  Only a small oversight.\n\nWe would and will definitely return.",

We normally go to Miller and carter in Stockport where we have always had great service and excellent food.\nUnfortunately our experience at Wilmslow was poor to say the least. we felt very rushed, the service was not up to the standard of Stockport. When our main courses were served we had no cutlery to eat with, as we had been sat in a quite corner it took 10 minutes for us to attract the attention of a member of staff. The quality of the the steak was tough and full of sinew. Having finished our meal we returned home. As  I got out of my car, we noticed the car had been damaged whilst park in the Miller and Carter car park. I have contacted Miller and Carter and was told that it happens all the time, and that she would check the CCTV.\nShe also told me she would call me a couple of days later. The young lady said she would confirm the vehicle which damaged my car and report it to the police. I have not heard back from Miller and Carter in Wilmslow. I have left several messages with no reply. I would highly recommend Miller and Carter in Stockport, and advise people not to bother with Wilmslow. Sorry to be negative, but what should have been a enjoyable night turned into a very expensive disaster.",

I am sorry to hear that you were unhappy with your dining experience here with us back at Christmas time, and had you let us know on the evening we would have certainly tried to rectify any issues for you at the time rather than you leave unhappy. It was myself that you spoke to on the car park that evening, and I explained to you that I can only give the CCTV footage to the police when they request it from me directly, I do not make the calls to the police on your behalf unfortunately. If you wish to pursue this through the police then I am more happy to provide them with any footage that they may require from me. All cars are parked in our car park at your own risk, as with most car parks. I am however sorry to hear that damage was caused to your vehicle on that evening.",

Our friend  whom recommended this restaurant  looked very ..disappointed.   Apparently we had lossed the table because there was three of us?  apparently we should not be mixing ??? this was not an issue when the table was booked. however i must say  they did us a huge favor as we  went to Gusto's Alderley Edge instead  .

I can appreciate the frustration you may of had with this however we are simply abiding by the guidelines that have been laid out to us by the government and local licencing officers. We ask the question when we seat guests to check that they too are abiding by the restrictions that are in place, and should they tell us that they are in fact from different households we are unable to go through with the booking.

I can assure you that your waitress would not have intentionally said this to humiliate you - instead she was reiterating the restrictions that are currently in place due to being in a tier 2 area. I will however speak to your waitress about being present during your meal as there should have been an opportunity for you to order more drinks whilst you were dining and for this I  apologize. As you have stated in your review you have previously had far better experiences at our restaurant so please reflect on those occasions, and accept our apology about yesterday evening. I wish you and your family a safe and lovely Christmas!",

All of our steaks go through a rigorous specification checklist before we begin the cooking process of any steaks. In theory, this prevents any issues with the quality of the steak from occurring, however, despite all of our checks, occasionally a steak my slip through the net. If this is ever the case, and if any other issues occur, we would hope that you bring this to our attention so that we have the opportunity to learn from it ourselves and more importantly, rectify the issue so that we can avoid poor experiences like this from happening. We are very approachable and happy to resolve any problems so please let us know.",

We ordered some nachos to share and what arrived was worse than I would expect from a local pub - broken bots of nachos, hardly any salsa or cheese sauce and something that purported to be guacamole but honestly smelt and tasted like old socks. I asked the waitress about it and she said they didnt make fresh guac \"because we are a steak house\" and that it was pre made and frozen. Honestly it was one of the most horrible things Ive ever tasted.\n\nBut anyway - apart from that the steaks are really good here - so if you want a good bit of beef, i would recommend it!",

After speaking with Katie your server from the evening she assured me that the order was read back to the table before sending through to the kitchen, but unfortunately as we are human,  mistakes can happen and the wrong steak was processed on this occasion. All of our meat has a visual check when delivered and sometimes we can not tell if a steak has grizzle present until it has been cooked, I am again sorry that this disappointed your daughter. Katie too apologises that you were not happy with your experience, and we do hope that you do decide to revisit us.

Crewe is fortunate to be a year old site, whereas we are a little older meaning we have had a little more wear and tear. The restaurant is checked each morning by the duty manager after the cleaner has carried out their work - I am sorry to hear that you were disappointed on this occasion. Moreover we do go through the service cycle with each guest when they arrive and we do ask that each party sanitise their hands upon arrival and implement the one way system. I will readdress this with the team to ensure that this is not missed with any guest that comes in to dine with us in the near future. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon.",

Unfortunately, due to the fact that we have limited spaces and too many people who abuse our car park, the car park is monitored by an external company. Whilst we should be reminding you on arrival to register your vehicle, we do hope that the abundance of external and internal signage would help point you in the direction of doing so. Nevertheless, if you would like to reach out to us directly, we can assist in getting this cancelled for you. I do hope the food and service aspect to your visit met expectations and I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

Sir Alex just looked at me and turned away, feeling this big now I asked again, he looked at me like only Sir Alex can, not good, i took the opportunity though and said \"i have to tell you, you are a genuine hero of mine, because i admire what you have achieved and the way youve done it, i support Manchester United because of you, i was bought up in North Wales, my parents and all my friends support Liverpool but i chose Manchester United because of you\" he smiled, reached and shook my hand, said \"thanks very much son, that means a lot\" i wobbled back to my table!, 15 mins later he got up to leave, as he passed me he stopped, shimmied to me and punched me in the shoulder a few times, said \"il see you son\" and off he went, his trailing wife said \"he always leaves me behind\", i saw them drive away through the window, in that big black Mercedes, LEGEND, best meal iv ever had.",

The service was terrible, firstly the bar staff were very rude and quite ignorant.50 mins waiting for starters 20mins waiting for dirty plates to be removed from tables, waiters / waitresses walking past and choosing to ignor our table. A further 50 mins waiting for mains,  this only came because we complained, at which point 5 waiters came to serve us and brought a cheap bottle of prosecco. How did our food miraculously appear with 5 waiters, 1 minute after we complained (how long had it been sat waiting to come out). There was 5 empty tables around us so they werent busy at all. We ate at the Manchester branch when it was heaving and got better service. Also a little boys phone was stolen. It was there when they left, then the waitress cleared the table and 3 ladies sat at the table, the boy came back with his dad to get his phone but nobody had seen it. On a good note the food was amazing but i wouldnt go back to that branch though and wouldn't recomend it",

We did try to compensate for your slightly longer waits, not only with a complimentary bottle of Prosecco but also a 20% discount of the total bill as a good will gesture. And yes you are correct a child did lose his phone that evening, however I believe this was later found in his parents car - an accusation of this being stolen is simply not true as we searched high and low for this to be found for him as quickly as possible. I do thank you for your feedback, and we take all comments on board to always try and improve our service.",

That aside we promptly moved only to be served (yet again) the most terrible tough salty almost inedible 'prime steak' burger ever tasted... From a steak house! I really don't want to go on as I'm sure this is a consistent view. I would suggest a lunch time drink in the sun, but the bar service will leave you needing to order at least two at once to relieve the waiting around for someone to even acknowledge you are there. Oh well, we'll see them next year and continue to live in hope... Come on, the simple things shouldn't be that hard!",

The quality of the meat was superb and it sliced as if it had been requested by the gods themselves, just the right amount of blood dripped from the steak, shyly though, almost asking your permission to do so, my permission was granted.\nThe flavour danced across my palate like pre-raphaelite cherubs dance across an oyster in those, frankly odd, cartoons of yore. Leaving you with a desire to exhale heartily while savouring each morsal. Accompanied by a superb selection of expertly prepared sides (I chose those though so you can't have credit for this :p) all culminating in me over eating and returning home to sleep of what was the most enjoyable meal of this year so far!\n\nWell done guys.",
