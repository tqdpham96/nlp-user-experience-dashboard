We were made really, really welcome and had a great evening in the pub after our day out.\nThe room has comfy, quiet (there's a reasonably busy road outside but on the Saturday night and Sunday morning we were there it was no problem) and clean.\nAll in all, a great place to stay and good value.  Highly recommend the King William!",

I couldn't get a picture of the hair and bodily fluid stains on the carpet because it was so gloomy. I'd have opened the blinds, but they were broken, with holes snapped out of them for? airflow maybe? Sheets had stains, I couldn't bring myself to pull back the matress cover and look.\nI'd booked in for 5 days... 5 minutes probably gave me 2 new diseases... as you can probably guess I checked out immediately.\nIt's taken 2 weeks to get a refund though... despite chasing the hotel and expedia multiple times, always being promised it in 3 working days, and then it never appearing for me to chase again.\nTo say the pictures of the rooms are catfishing gone wild, would be an understatement.\nDo yourself a favour - don't pay at check in... go and see your room first.\nThe old reviews have managed to keep this over a 4... honestly, look at the more recent ones and you'll build a picture for yourself.",

We had a cosy night and slept like logs.\n\nThe pub is modern and looks like a great place for a drink and some food, it was friendly with such kind owners who met our needs and welcomed us well.\nYou would expect a pub b&b to be quite loud while you’re in the room but it was so quiet we couldn’t hear any of the guests downstairs and we had an undisturbed stay.\n\nWe would definitely return!😀",

But for me on a business trip (and who likes to stay somewhere clean) I was not very comfortable.\n\nIt's not a B&B as they don't offer any breakfast and Wilmslow is hardly a hub of cafes. There's only wifi in the pub and garden, which are fine but not really conducive to a single person working. There's no desk or table in the tiny room so I had to work on the single bed. They didn't accept Amex which was not mentioned anywhere but not that unusual I guess. No one's around in the morning to check you out so you just leave your keys in the door, which has no chain or lock on the inside. Windows single-glazed, and it was a very hot week so I needed to keep them open anyway. Not ideal on a main road and with all the summer bugs that came for a visit. Only a small blind (no curtains).\n\nI guess all of that would be absolutely fine for a basic room if it had been clean. Much dirtier and I would have gone somewhere else... I've added pictures that show the room was just not well looked after, peeling paint, rotting skirt, mouldy shower screen, hairs in the bath, empty toiletries... just not for me I'm afraid. I was glad to be leaving after one night. But thank you for a nice welcome on check-in.",

                "text": "Terrible. I can't comment on the actual pub as I was staying overnight, but any pub that has shut the bar by 10 on a Thursday can't be that good.\n\nBooked through late rooms for a business trip in Wilmslow. A breakdown of my experience:\n\nI arrived around 8PM having been taken to dinner by my clients\n\nCheck-in: Terrible. The bar staff had no idea who I was, or about my booking. All they could find was my name in a book. No details about whether I had pre-paid or not. The Web-site upon booking had  said it was a Pay Now rate, but did not in the confirmation e-mail. Still keeping a close eye  on my credit card charges to see if I'm double charged. I asked what time breakfast is served to be told I had to have pre-booked breakfast. Luckily I had my e-mail open to prove it. The whole time through the check in process the staff member was muttering about someone not doing their job properly. Not my problem! As he was the only member of staff on he was trying to check me in, server food from the kitchen and answer phones at the same time. After paying I asked for a VAT receipt, to be told they don't issue them. Hoping work will take my booking confirmation and credit card as proof for my expenses! I was hurredly showed to the room where I was told in the morning I'd have to exit by the back fire exit as the door to the bar will be locked.\n\nThe room:  Well in need of a refurb. The bed was hard, the linens were old and threadbare. The communal Iron had something burned onto it that I was afraid would melt onto my shirts. How it happened I don;t know as the Iron barely worked. There was some sort of damp/decay problem in the bathroom which meant there was grout powder and paint flakes all over the end of the bath. I doubt the amount there was just after a day, more likely a couple of weeks but the rest of the room seemed clean enough.\n\nNot long after getting to the room I heard a knock on the door. A lady was there with my \"continental breakfast\". Two croissants (they already felt a little stale) a juice box and a yogurt bar.\n\nAfter settling in, and calling my wife went to have a drink at the bar and get the wifi password. The bar was closed. It was barely passed 10. Resigned to a sober night returned to my room, tried in vain to use my iphone as a hotspot for e-mails\n\nIn the morning: The Shower head was broken and kept sliding down the bar. There was a little bottle of shower gel that had already been opened on it's side in the soap dish. It had spilled and dried up so much it was almost glued on. There was also an open large bottle of Waitrose body wash. The \"Coffee and Tea making facitilies\" in the room were a joke. It took me some time to find the coffee (no tea) as the dish the sachets were in was on top of the wardrobe. The Kettle only worked if you kept the button pressed down by hand, and had it sitting on the base just right. There was no milk, and a little exposed bowl of sugar with bits of dirt in it. The sugar looked weird, so I did test a little of it after scooping the top off, only to find it was salt. The coffee from the sachet I used first was small black and hard. It was a brand I'd never seen so tried pouring water on it. It wouldn't dissolve, and stuck to the spoon like a black syrup.\n\nCheck-out: I couldn't wait to get out. I now had the dilema of what to do with the key. Looking around the room there was no hotel information (although there were 3 bibles in the draw). I decided to leave the key in the room. Upon leaving I saw some pamphlets on a table near the exit, and a notice in clear plastic asking you to leave the key in the room, and that lost keys would incur a £20 charge. Walking out the fire exit at the back you find yourself in an enclosed small yard full of rubbish. The door has no handle to re-enter the pub (guess you need the room key) so I had to open the large gate to the yard to leave. Not the nicest of jobs whilst carrying an overnight  bag of essentials wearing a suit.",
