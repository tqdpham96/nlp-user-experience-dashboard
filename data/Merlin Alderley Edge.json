We had a table if a little small for six males but the staff were overstretched. For a meal booked at 1 we didn't really get served until 2 and they had lost our pre-booked order. So the prestige Christmas lunch was slightly tarnished and they kept forgetting the extras that offered. I guess such is Christmas time and my guests all enjoyed themselves. We didn't leave until 5 inpart because of the service but reflected our relaxed mood as well.\nI give it 4 Star because everyone enjoyed the food which was very good.\nMuch better this year . All the good points none of the bad!",

The fresh Cod on our fish and chips dish is battered to order and deep fried, we then put a touch of rock salt on the top to enchance the flavour. This is the same with our skinny fries and chunky chips, we add salt to the chips before we send them out. This is common practice in the majority of restaurants.\n\nI am pleased to hear we remedied the situation for you with no fuss.\nThe manageress is correct in stating if you don't want any extra salt on your dishes to inform us before ordering and we will ensure it comes out plain.\n\nI do hope we will see you again soon and we will be awarded that elusive fith star!!!\n\nGary & Team Merlin",

No complaints about the breakfast. I would suggest a bit of a freshen up with the decor in the hotel overall as the dark green makes the place look quite dated and dark. Overall its pretty good value for money and there is free parking forcguests,  but recomend they dont.enter Four in a bed.",

These were served & the meat was raw, we attempted to eat the meat & struggled to even cut it as well as digesting it. The rest of the dinner was getting cold because of struggling with the meat. We finally got the attention of one of the young male food servers. They didn't take the plate of food away, they just came back with 2 slices of beef (1 slice each) which didn't replace the amount on the original dinner plate. Also were we expected to eat off the same plate which had the existing raw meat on it. Also\nwe were expected to eat the gravy & vegetables that was with the raw meat. We couldn't continue with the meal yet we paid half price for a meal we  couldn't eat.Also drinks for a afternoon family get together\nthat was a disaster. It spoilt the whole day.\nThe table was booked under my daughters  name Hewitt. I'd appreciate a response as I wouldn't like anyone else experiencing this.",

We had to ask for cutlery quite a few times (whilst our dinner going cold in front of us- they brought food but didn’t notice no cutlery and were gone before we could ask for it) We had to ask for drinks a number of times repeatedly. I asked for a drink for my daughter 5 times with 3 different people before we got it. The blackcurrant mousse which was £7.50 was literally an inch square and didn’t come with anything it suggested it did on the menu. We had literally 6 different people all serving us - you’d ask one person for the wine list and they’d send someone different to help and they’d try to take a drinks order (but not having given us the wine list). Food itself was good. Main course was tasty but came about half an hour after the kids food. All in all I won’t be going back - about £124 not well spent !",

What a disappointment this was from start to finish.\nWe were a family of four, 2 adults and 2 children. The starters arrived, no problem except I was served a dessert spoon for my soup and this came with no bread or offering of bread although on the menu it says it is served with bread. The main was a huge disappointment and I can only assume that there was a shortage of vegetables as we were given a small bowl of sprouts and green beans that was required to serve three, hardly the selection of festive vegetables we were expecting and is listed on the menu. I had the Vegan option which also came with no accompanying sides whatsoever and consisted of the Wellington and some broccoli, again no purée that was listed on the menu. The desserts again were served with a mixture of dessert and soup spoons, and the bowl my youngest daughters dessert was served in was chipped, we also didn’t receive the Green & Blacks Chocolates listed  on the menu. Finally, where we were sat was like a sauna and even the waitress commented on how hot it was. All in all a poor experience, badly planned and presented and didn’t justify the price we paid which was around 400£ with drinks.",

We have made a desicion as a business to not sell real ale as after doing lots of trials with different ales as it hasn't proven popular enough for us to sell it. If you also take into account the shelf life of ale (no longer than a week) we were finding a lot of wastage each week. I am very sorry to hear that on the night you were with us you feel we closed early. This is only done on very rare occasions and on these occasions we have to make this desicion to make outrselves viable as a business. This is typically only done on extremely quiet night with very minimal trade and will never be before 10:30pm.\nPlease accept our appologies. We hope to welcome you back again soon.\nBrad",

We are still a pub with a very busy restaurant and our Asahi Cube is very popular with functions.\n\nI think your description of Beavertown Neck Oil IPA is very unfair (yes I did look up what what urochrome means) as it is a very popular beer and available in the majority of pubs in the area. Maybe you should have awarded your 2* review to the brewery as you didn't like the beer as opposed to The Merlin.\n\nWe do have a large range of alternative beers, wines and spirits for our guests to enjoy.\n\nHopefully you can join us again soon for a different beverage.\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\nGary & Team Merlin",

My mum unfortunately had to send hers back as the beef was too red for her, I’d definitely suggest asking  the customer how they prefer their meat to be cooked as they do in most restaurants serving Sunday roasts.\nI had also ordered the Chocolate bomb Biscoff dessert and when it arrived was extremely disappointed and underwhelmed for a dessert that nearly cost £8 I would have expected a big classic brownie with the chocolate bomb on top, not a chocolate shell with a rock hard piece of small cubed brownie and a teaspoon of Biscoff to go with?\nI’ve awarded a 5 out of 10 because the staff were polite. I’m so sorry this is the most negative review I’ve written in a long time and don’t like writing them but felt quite strongly about this especially as I paid nearly £30 and could of gone to the Ivy in Manchester on that budget",

Had dinner there yesterday and it was awful.\nThe starters were fine and came out reasonably soon, but we had to wait a further 45 mins for our main course. When the order came out, the order was incorrect and the food was dry and nowhere near the previous standards... The restaurant was about 50% full, so the kitchen was hardly flat out.\nOn top of that, the waitress (she was pretty much on her own serving) gave us incorrect info regarding my youngest's order (they no longer do nuggets and chips for kids) which led to a child meltdown... I don't blame her as she was so overworked. I suppose this is what \"Taking back control\" means in practical terms.\nAlso, there was virtually no sparking wine on the menu. Every time my wife ordered a drink, she was told that they didn't have in in stock. We were told that management had changed the entire menu just before Xmas and therefore it hadn't been restocked (????).\n\nOverall we were extremely disappointed and won't be returning.",

We asked if we needed to book a table but were told that was not necessary. Arrived around 15 minutes later. Waited a few minutes for someone to actually greet us, eventually a young guy came over and very abruptly asked us what we were waiting for. I asked which tables were OK to sit with the dogs and he said for drinks? and I said no food. He rudely and abruptly said unless you have booked a table you can't eat we are fully booked. There was hardly anyone in  both bar and restaurant and  only a couple of the tables in the bar area were occupied. We reiterated what the man on the phone told us only for him to start speaking to someone else. Used to really like it in here but not sure we would go again with the way we were spoken to.",

I am sorry to hear you did not like our Vegan Burger and I will pass your comments onto our kitchen team to see where we can improve.

The salad's we ordered came after about 30 mins, I asked for some salt & also asked where my drink was. They brought my daughters drink out.... still no sign of mine! When my Latte finally arrived (whilst I was eating my meal!) it was cold! The waitress came over about 10 mins after we had finished, she never bothered to ask if everything was ok, if she had I would have told her rather than writing a review. The Beef salad we had wasn't that impressive either, I definitely wouldn't recommend The Merlin.\nShort description of our visit - Poor service, cold coffee & a huge disappointment!",

We had to install the carparking system as it was not just our clientele that was parking here.  It is our course free for our guests they just have to register there registration number. If you would like to dicuss the matter futher our contact number is 01625599959. Many regards and hope we can help to get the matter resolved Vicki  Assistant Manager",

None of us saw the signs. Yes there was something there, but It doesn’t’ really matter if you have 15 or 150 signs if it’s so dark you can’t read them. Or I guess we are too elderly to notice. And speaking about elderly you should do a Risk Assessment of your car park area and you will realize it’s unsafe to use after dark. Fire department will tell you this. My opinion that is….\n\nAs for the signs inside, I can’t really tell, I never went near the bar, but you don’t really pay attention, as I said it used to be free before and you will not notice a sign unless you are looking for it.\n\nYes, it was surprisingly easy to park, that was because the place was half empty on a Friday evening and no, we will not be coming back.",

Secondly your comment on the car park lighting was skipped over simply as it has no basis to stand on as we have multiple flood lights covering the car park illuminating the signs for people to see which is backed up by our 5* EHO (Environmental Health Office) rating, and I can assure you all our risk assessments required by law are all up to date.  Lastly instead of complaining on our social platforms, if you had got in touch with us by email or over the phone we could have dealt with the whole ordeal in a much more civilised manor, leading to the termination of the ticket if you simply could provide proof of purchase at our establishment and hence prove you had used our facilities.

We had no chestnuts with our sprouts, there was no sapphire with my salmon. We had to ask for our coffee that was included in a set menu, then we had to ask for the chocolates to go with it. This was disappointing as it was my birthday meal on boxing day. Then to add to the disappointment when we went down to breakfast the next day they had no sausage or mushrooms, and the egg yolks were hard. Just a big let down.",

On arrival.. just old to take a seat and no-one came for half an hour ..like a funeral parlour. Whilst waiting we decided to buy a drink.  No welcome glass of bubbly...NO FESTIVE DECORATIONS ON THE TABLE. We had to ask for Christmas crackers.  No feeling of the day at all...not even festive music!  Cost something like £70 but food was very average.  It used to be our favourite place for lunch for years but feel we were ripped off so won't ever be going again or make recommendations.  By the way, I wrote to management afterwards as we were all disappointed but got no reply.",

I can only presume crackers were forgotten of your table in haste of trying to get it relayed for you. As for the music, our music is controlled externally, however, i can assure you festive music was playing throughout our festive period.   As for your letter of concern, i can only apologize that this wasn't addressed as we strive to respond to all our feedback. With this is mind, We'd like the opportunity to discuss this with you. Please reach out to us at 01625 599959 to speak to the manager at your earliest convenience to discuss how we can restore your faith in the Merlin.  Leighanna and the team.",

The ambience was nice and chilled, the music playlist was good and the decor is nice.  There is plenty of parking to the rear and a nice terrace to the front which is nice in the summer. The food was great, but people were looking forward to a roast which they had run out of so was a little disappointing. The staff were very friendly and welcoming, I think we were the last ones in and the time ran away from us but the staff didn't have a problem and were very accommodating. All in all nice restaurant and will definitely be returning.",

RUDE B  I thought.\nour actual waitress was very nice.\nI ordered the Trio Roast dinner\nGot a plate with 2 slices of beef that was very tasty, a leg of chicken that was,,,,ok and a slice of pork that was emmm not the best... a couple of roast potatoes and a pretty small stuffing wrapped in bacon. my partner had the lamb roast, the lamb i tasted was extremely tough and chewy. she said some was nice, some was not.\nset between us was one dish of cabbage and a couple of chunks of carrot, whist it was very very nice (covered in butter) I fell that it wasn't enough both for 2 and as extras to dinner.\nThen I noticed the pork crackling was missing (comes with meal)so I had to re order that. now that was the nicest crackling ever!\nhowever we also noticed that the sauces had not come and we had to re-order them too. I had a pint of cider and she had sparkling water, overall price was £43. worth it? I really do not think so\nIf you are going to be paying over £40 for lunch it should be a good lunch with good service. this was not . yes some of the food was good, but overall my conclusion is that we are never going there again.",
