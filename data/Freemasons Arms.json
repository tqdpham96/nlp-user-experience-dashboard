The member of staff said that I threw the receipt at her which wasn't true. I just threw away the receipt.\n\nI understand that it's a long night for staff but this member of staff complained to the manager who immediately started berating me and talking to me like a child whilst wagging her finger in my face. I wasn't even asked for my side of the story. It was just a complete lack of respect and understanding. A reasonable approach would have completely de-escalated the situation.\n\nI am sorry but I don't go and spend my hard earned money in a place to be talked down to like that. Maybe it would be more appropriate to get the other persons point of view next time because nothing was done with bad intention, I was joking and would have apologised if things weren't ramped up so quickly by the manager.",

The new owner has a dog & the pub smells very strongly of dog ( I am not a dog owner) and the back of house was disgusting, I caught a glimpse of cupboards ganging off and EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE. wires all over the place, needs a rewire. The guitars (ornaments) on the walls are snapped and shabby looking. The carpets has been cleaned which is a bonus! The toilets have had a like of emulsion... on tiles... strange I know. The toilets also have a car air freshener hanging in them??? Mini soccer table, sports tv & darts available but the dingieness deffinetly put me right off.",
