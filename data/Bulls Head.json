Asked for condiments which were never brought and the waitress offered colouring which never arrived. Ended up paying for our bill at the bar as we were waiting for it for a long while and had to request the missing items be taken off. Despite this, the food was presented nicely and was okay despite the missing condiments, leaving the breakfast sandwiches being very dry. Unfortunate for a first visit I'm afraid.",

The food was definitely worse than ever before. However, the deserts were the biggest disappointment. From something that was irresistible to something more like unedible. There was four of us and each ordered a different desert. The fruit tarts were soggy rather than with a nice crunchy base, sticky toffi pudding was dry and hard at the bottom, obviously microwaved, apple pie again all soggy. Everything was microwaved. Sadly after years of going there we won't be coming back. The only good thing about this place is still their great service. Shout of to the lady that's always there looking after the customers best she can! 5*",

( the resturant was maybe 75% full I have been in there when much busier .\nMy steak was cooked but cold! The herb butter on top still solid so very obvious it was even warm The vine tomatoes weren‚Äôt cooked the salad had no dressing and was wilted.\nWe asked, the waitress to please to change it . The waitress was rude and kept telling us it‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day weekend  it‚Äôs busy ( it was Saturday night not Mother‚Äôs Day  )\nShe took away my Food , then came back with our chatty to say we hadn‚Äôt had to wait king as the check said we had only waited 35 minutes , we tried to say yes but we have been here since 7pm . She then just didn‚Äôt stop telling us we‚Äôre busy , you‚Äôre wrong you haven‚Äôt had to wait long  at all . They are busy in the kitchen and and and ‚Ä¶ we didn‚Äôt react , smiled politely and said please bring me my food. She just got angrier and  angrier digging herself into a bigger hole . It was our fault the staff were busy the kitchen was busy and we know when we arrived in the resturant and how long we had waited to be served .\nWe were just left feeling accused of being in the wrong because they were busy , but honestly they weren‚Äôt that busy and even if they were it wasn‚Äôt her place to tell us basically we were lying about the time we waited or the food being cold !\nRude and not what anyone wants when paying for a meal of any type .\nThe food was very mediocre , slapped down in front of us .\nWe left feeling like we were wrong in wanting service or properly cooked good !\nEven though we have been here before with slightly better service , we won‚Äôt be going again or recommending .\nI wouldn‚Äôt recommend it unless you are related for rude treatment and ping waiting times .\nIf at the beginning we had been told service would be slow due to being busy maybe it would have all gone better\n\nJulie",

There is some patio seating, but it's right next to a busy road and at rush hour wasn't the most relaxing. Hoped for a window seat but they only had half the dining room open at the time and they were all spoken for. Good pints and lovely atmosphere.",

Fries aren't available on the NCIG menu as they cook them in a fryer that has come into contact with items that do contain gluten, so mum could have ordered them as a side off the main menu if she wanted to.\n\nMy biggest bugbear was that I ordered the feta flat bread, which should have had humous, avocado, pomegranate, olives and lambs lettuce. Part way through, I realised there was no avocado or pomegranate at all! When I mentioned this to the waitress, she checked with the chef and they didn't have any! If I had been given that information, I would have opted for the steak sandwich, but by then it was too late.\n\nIn all fairness, the waitress was lovely about it and I think the chef may have had a little telling off, but of course common sense should have prevailed! The desserts were lovely! Again, the raspberry coulis and strawberries accompanying mum's cheesecake were missing, but the waitress noticed and brought some fresh raspberries out, at least!\n\nA bit more thought and it could be really good!",

We were a walk in and managed to get a table but if you‚Äôre going at peak lunchtime I would advise booking ahead of time just in case.\n\nOrdered the slow cooked beef rib roast which literally fell off the bone! So tender and delicious. Got a side of pigs in blankets as an add on as well and they were huge and delicious! These were like hogs in duvets! Great value for money and the wait staff are always friendly and happy to help.",

The reason we have had to put this in is because the car park was being abused by non Bulls Head guests.  Which meant there was no spaces for our guests or worse still guests thinking we are full and then driving on by when in fact we was empty. The car park is technically free if you buy a drink or food with us as we take the money off your bill.  Or if you know your reg plate number you can pop it into the tablet we have at the end of the bar.   I will speak to the company who looks after our car park and see if we can get some form of lighting around the machine.    Thank you for your feedback.",

Always a pleasant atmosphere and staff.\nThe food however is definitely hit and miss.\nOrdered two Sunday dinners today.\nA trio of meats and a mixed grill, they took ages to come, two drinks (lemonade) later.\nThe meat tasted like pre sliced frozen and then reheated. It was also tough and dried out, especially at the edges. It had obviously been left standing, as most of the food was barely warm, and I am sure that was just down to the gravy.\nThe mixed grill was also poor, with the gammon like leather!\nThe meals were not cheap at 11.99 and 16.99\nSo I would have expected real food, with real taste.\nIt's a shame that the pub let's its self down with the lack of quality food.\nBut this could easily change.",

I've been to a few Chef and Brewers across the Midlands and the North and I might be biased as I'm always in the right frame of mind but the food was excellent as ever, they can make a burger into a work of art, which I turn all too quickly into an empty platter. On this occasion the big burger 5 *. The staff have always been on top form friendly,  attentive and show genuine customer care, well done. Always a pleasure see you again soon.",

The risotto dish was obviously some instant packet mix from the supermarket but was edible I enough. The fish pie resembled instant mash potato with a few cold prawns mixed in and no sauce - just totally dry.  When I complained, the waitress offered to mix up some sauce and pour it over!  If ordering food, stick to fish n chips or just buy crisps from the bar.",
