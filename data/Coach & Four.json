Our waitress, Erin (sp?), a South African too, was a delight.

Overall, a great experience.",

I had the steak and ale pie which was nice however the filling was quite watery and had hardly any meat in it, it was mostly carrots and celery. The chips were lovely though and were definitely home made. We were left with empty glasses on the table (there was 8 of us) and no-one came to ask if we wanted more drinks until our food was being served. Would expect better service considering the prices in this place. I'm giving this place 4 stars however, I would definitely return, but wouldn't pick the steak and ale pie again.",

Food is beautiful, very well presented and delicious. I would definitely recommend coming here for a meal, it is also a lovely place just to stop by for a drink.

I always feel a little bit underwhelmed, which is a shame, because it had the potential to be the best in the area. The outside area is absolutely comical for the centre of wilmslow. It's like it's been put together in home base.\n\nBreakfast was pretty bad. Overly thin black pudding, toast came after the breakfast, coffee was very bitter, and £3.40 for crumpets, while a breakfast sandwich is £3.95 ? Had no idea the crumpets were made of gold.\n\nWill still always use the pub as it's the best location. But I feel I will always be accepting second best.\n\nHave to say the servers are excellent.",

The food menu is extensive and should include something for all tastes no matter how fussy.\n\nI should also add that the live bands on a Friday evening are worth checking out. The regular \"house\" band called \"Uncovered\" are excellent and always get people out of their seats for a boogie.\n\nFinally, if you are at a loose end on the evening of the first Thursday of every month then why not check out the Comedy evening.  Tickets are only £6 and while some of the stand up comedians can be a little disappointing, there is generally one that delivers plenty of laughs.",
