Drinks prices are reasonable tbh and the service is always good. Not really an issue but personally I don't like service charge being added I prefer to leave a tip myself and tbf the service charge was a smaller percent than I would of tipped myself, not an issue just a personal thing. It does say on the receipt you can ask for the service charge to be removed but I feel that would be awkward, I guess it kind of guarantees they get a tip which I totally agree with but just like to do it myself. You deffo get what you pay for here and I do like the decor and set up of the place. We went at 14.45 and I heard the staff say this was the quiet time but it was still busy but had a nice atmosphere. Will deffo be going again some time soon",

Have to say, it was excellent from start to finish. Service was friendly and prompt. We ordered the sharing platter and when we tried to order extras (eyes bigger than our stomachs) the server recommended we substitute items on the platter which was a nice gesture. Particularly enjoyed the brisket, which was tender and full of smoky flavour, and the fries, which were well seasoned and the right level of crispiness. The only criticism my wife and I could come up with was that the BBQ beans contained a bit too much meat, but really that's just splitting hairs. Genuinely delicious and great value for money, would heartily recommend it.",

The staff are amazingly polite and attentive and made loads of fuss of her for her birthday, which she loved!\n\nThe food... Oh yes it is amazing. A carnivore's delight. I had the platter for one and the brisket and ribs just melted. The amount of food was just about right - I didn't have room for a pudding but that's no big deal for me. Others also really enjoyed their mains. Dessert was also great with my son having the waffles.\n\nThe only niggle of the evening wasn't really the restaurant's fault and will make me sound a bit grumpy... I cannot stand it when parents just let their kids run riot in restaurants, no matter if they are family friendly. Because of when we ate, the place was full of kids who were constantly in and out of some doors to the outside that backed onto the bench that we sat at such that the doors were slamming into us pretty much every minute for first half hour or so. Luckily it calmed down and I don't think the kids really noticed this... Just my old-fashioned ways and, had it not been for this, would have awarded 5*.\n\nWould definitely come again but later on when the kids are in bed!",

Upon booking I was asked for special requests in which I informed them it was one of our guests 30th Birthday and we wanted to be sat near the cinema room as we had our 4 year old child with us who loves the cinema room and often taken in her food to eat in there. When we arrived we were asked to wait for 5/10 minutes whilst the guests before paid their bill, which we had no problem doing. We were then asked if our 4 year old would be ok on a higher chair to which we said no as I knew she wouldn‚Äôt like the high chair. So after declining this we were sat in the garden room instead, which whilst is a beautiful room it is on the other end of the restaurant to the cinema room so my daughter could not walk to and from there by herself, hence she did not get to go in until the end of the meal otherwise one of us adults would‚Äôve spent the meal eating alone. We did asked to be moved but was told it would be 30 minutes wait.\nAlso nothing was done for the 30th Birthday, usually they put up a little sign or something.\nThis wouldn‚Äôt deter us from returning but I think I will ring up to book next time rather than online.",

I would say there was too much ice in it so order without!\nMy partner ordered steak and eggs. The steak was supposed to be rare. It came out medium to well. We sent it back and I think the manager came over to apologise with was all fine. The issue was that the re-cooking of the steak took way too long and it still wasn't to his liking but by this point he just accepted it because I had already finished my meal and my 1 year old was getting bored. There was also a lack of flavour in the steak.\n\nI would recommend coming here as we have been here before and had no issues. I just probably wouldn't recommend getting the steak if you are quite particular with the way it is cooked.",

The menu was extensive, and there was lots of meat dishes available. I ordered the waffle (which was huge), with bacon drizzled with maple syrup. It was very tasty. We knew that portions were big, so I didn't have a starter (or dessert). Would definitely go again, but the prices were on the high side, on par with TGIs. Would keep it for special occasions. The staff were very attentive and polite. Thank you.",

I hate to single out service staff as I know this industry has took a massive hit and 90% off all restaurants are probably massively under staffed so are probably over worked but when your food is served and you haven‚Äôt been given enough knifes and forks and have to go asking for them is pretty poor standards as it‚Äôs a simple thing they should be sorted before you take your seat  , then 2 of the 4 drinks come and I had to go chasing my drinks again simple things bring all the drinks in one go.

We felt very welcome and comfortable as soon as we sat down. (James I think it was, a credit to your restaurant!)\nWe walked past 4 staff members on the way out, all of which thanked us for coming and said goodbye, excellent hospitality. Just a point that this is not something I expect normally, especially nowadays, but it was a noticeable gesture and they all seemed genuine when they said it.\n\nWould definitely return!",

We were surprised on leaving that the birthday donut had been taken away when clearing the table!  Other than that the 11 of us had a great time. Thank you.",

We drove half an hour to come here wanting to try somewhere new and seeing the previous good reviews. From the minute we got here it was amazing. The decor is lovely, way better than majority of pub restaurants. Our food was delicious and the authentic American dishes are awesome. Portion sizes were generous and look as good as they taste. Drinks menu is brilliant. American import drinks give you new drinks to try at reasonable prices and my god the milkshakes are immense. The biggest thing that gets me writing a review is the customer service. It‚Äôs not often you go somewhere where every single member of staff is so welcoming and attentive. From the waitresses/waiters to the lads behind the bar, they all can‚Äôt do enough for you and really make it worth while. Will 1000% be back here again soon and will recommend to everyone",

I pushed my luck by going without reservation. Parking lot was completely full and place looked packed but luckily they still had a table in the bar section where I got served without any problems. Ideal place for both families and solo (business) travelers like me. Nobody will look weird at you for opening your laptop at the table. Loved it.\n\nTheir WiFi requires complicated logging in to social media and giving scary consents. Avoided using it. Pity that they have set it up this way.\n\nOnly negative point, if I have to mention something, would be that they add tip for themselves to the bill already without asking or informing. That doesn't feel right. Luckily the service was good enough to deserve a tip, but already assuming it is inappropriate.\n\nResponse to the owner response:\nI have read the standard reply on the tipping with other reviews already.

Really great from the start, then we met Sophie who was looking after our menu orders and drinks by Alex, I have to say even though they were short staffed and the restaurant was pretty steady they took the time to have a decent conversation With us, and never looked dismissive or stressed and that meant the world to us. Could have spoken to Sophie and Alex all day. This was the first time we had ever been to Hickory Steakhouse and I was blown away by the level of service and conversation we had received, a lot could be learned from these 2, it really could. We loved it. The food and drinks were out of this world, it was above and beyond my expectation particularly we just turned up no booking. And to top it off Alex and Sophie sent a desert and candle right at the end, which we certainly didn‚Äôt ask for, and this was a beautiful touch to finish what was one of my best experiences in a restaurant. Great work Alex & Sophie, perfect really was and thank you",

Great options for American food and definitely would recommend to try.\n\nWouldn't be in a mega rush to return as it wasn't AMAZING with flavours just the meat was the softest I could ask for.  4.5 for this place I would try again in the future.",

Food is smokehouse southern US so ribs, baby back,briskets but also lots of various burgers,po boy, gumbo's etc. The mains tastes great,are generous, and the price is the same as a standard boring pub. In a nutshell great value for money. The atmosphere is really good with nice lighting, great US country/bluegrass type music in the background,lots of drinks to choose from. And if you have younger kids and they finish earlier than you their meals,there is a cinema room where they will get popcorn and watch a kids movie(Toy Story 4 in our case). Only very slightly minus point,the service from waitress was average (not really smiley) but I'm picking. Food comes out fast too . Loved it!!! 5 stars!!",

I initially came here for ease, but the quality of service and food on night one meant I had to return the following night and the night after.\nBrisket and chicken waffles were top drawer and great value.\nI was meant to be travelling home the following night but the cold snap froze my car battery, leaving me with a 7 hour wait for the AA to jump-start me. The kindness of everyone at Hickory's was amazing; regularly checking on me and the AA's progress, asking around for jump leads, keeping me warm, and keeping me company. The flat battery had every chance of ruining a great few days but it only enhanced it down to the personable and thoughtful team.\nAbsolute credit to themselves. I will be returning as soon as possible.",

We had a table booked for 7.30pm and the lady who greeted us said our table wasn‚Äôt ready and to have a drink at the bar. We waited 15 minutes but then noticed people coming in were going straight to their tables. When I went back to ask if our table was ready she asked our name again, and then went away, we was clearly forgotten about.\nWe were then taken to our table which was right next to the children‚Äôs cinema room, biggest mistake ever. Children were left to run round the restaurant all night being extremely noisy whilst their parents sat happily on their tables at the other side of the restaurant. This place feels like an unorganised cr√®che than a restaurant.\nFood was nice, waitress seemed a little uninterested and everything seemed an effort for her.\nWon‚Äôt be returning anytime soon.",

Extremely unprofessional behaviour from the manager who had no people skills.\nMy parents had driven from Wales and myself and my friend had come from Nottinghamshire. We hadn't seen them since July and they booked as a treat for us all. They have eaten there many times before and booked having requested to sit  in the garden room. The manager's behaviour was poor he made no attempt to help or offer us any compromise.\nThe meals all came out separate then they dropped my dad's meal. My neices hot dog came out then 10mins later her side orders arrived! Not good enough from a well know company such as Hickorys.\nMy Mum was very upset by the way we were treated.\nThe manager was totally out of order he offered no apology. On our way out the garden room still wasn't full and chairs had been added to tables where he told us they couldn't. Our faces just didn't fit.\nPoor",

They have specialty days: Mon -Thurs eg Hotdogs on Tuesday... something else on Weds, etc...\n\nWe decided because we were in a bit of a rush, so we sat in the bar area and selected appetisers of the menu.\n\nThe staff were welcoming on arrival and friendly throughout. Had a laugh with one of the bar staff, who got me to do the Pepsi Challenge and I nailed it! Get in!\n\nWe ordered the Ribs, chicken wings in bourbon sauce and skinny fries. It cost ¬£19 and was delicious! It took about 10mins for the food to arrive which was good. The food was delicious!\n\nThe steaks on the menu vary in price. The menu is available online.\n\nThere's plenty of parking. The restaurant is just near the Lindow Common.\n\nOverall, highly recommended when uou have saved a few quid. It's not cheap but I feel its worth it!",

                "text": "Where to start? Having been to the glorious Hickory's in Chester, on the River Dee for a first date with my fiancee a fair few years ago in 2017.. I thought it would be a good recommendation for the family to celebrate my birthday here. As it was fairly local for my family coming from Rochdale and Runcorn.\n\nHaving seen the reviews I thought great, food will be the same quality. Service will be top notch.\n\nWe have a family of 9 including my 87 year old nan and 5 month old son, so a good range of ages. We called up about 7 weeks ago to book for July 23rd (my birthday was 9th) it was fully booked up, I thought no problem table of 9 must be a difficult one to manage to squeeze in...we were told a 6 week wait on a party this size...so rebooked for this evening (6/8/22)\nAfter excitedly leaving work early and picking up my family and meeting the rest at the restaurant at 7 for our table.\n\nWe were met with what I can only describe as someone looking like the most stressed out man I've ever seen managing seating arrangements. The guy had a beard, couldn't read if he had a name badge but there wasn't a \"Welcome to Hickory's\" in there. Which would have been nice.\n\nThe place was packed out, car park full. I thought brill looks like a good atmosphere. A young worker then brought us over to the table and asked halfheartedly \"who's birthday is it?\" I said \"mine but rather belated\"...a very insincere \"happy birthday\" followed as we were shown the seat.\nNext we were greeted by a third worker who asked the same question...same reaction...same again. I thought \"wow does anyone get excited here? It's a BBQ place and it's busy let's go, let's make it exciting no?!\" .......There was however a chalkboard pig with happy birthday scribbled on it.\n\nWe awaited the rest of the family to turn up but ordered drinks...after a while and everyone had got a drink we ordered. A fair few meals totalling nearly ¬£300 for the bill.\nThe food was... okay...I've had better at tru reds BBQ in Leeds and Manchester and this was a gut punch as I'd recommended this place to the family. My sister's ribs were full of fat, hardly any meat. My father's and my sharing platter looked like it had stood for 20 minutes before it landed at the table, I couldn't explain what the beans and pulled pork looked like, but it would have been at home on a food meme page.\n\nI tried to stay positive (after all I do adore the Hickory's pale ale, the only saving grace). My fianc√©e's brisket meal didn't even turn up and we had to ask where it was... our server had to go fetch it that was 5 minutes later..\n\nIn the backdrop I can hear all sorts of happy birthdays from the team to other customers, groups of maybe 4 or 5. We waited maybe something might happen...nope. It appeared we were forgotten about. Hard to think really when we were a massive table ready to enjoy a good evening, seated right near the bar, wedged in together. It took us 2 hours  from sitting down, to eating, to being offered a dessert menu...even that was an effort for our server. Fast forward to 930 and I had to get up and ask for the bill.\nA service charge of 7.5% totalling nearly ¬£20 was added....now usually I am happy to slap on a bit more if I am wowed by the service, as I work in the customer service industry as a jeweller. I expect good service wherever I go. I value good service, I'll pay for good service. Not mind blowing, but just someone to go out of their way with one thing...this time around everything seemed disorganised, unpolished and poor service wise, so we took the charge off the bill.\n\nIf the food would have matched my previous experience I'd have scored higher. But the fact I couldn't even find the floor manager to pass on my feedback showed me exactly why the experience tonight fell so far short of my previous experience at Chester and my expectation.\n\nAs birthday meals go it's one to forget and I'm still frustrated I suggested it.\n\nA shame really as I'd heard good things about this place.",

When you go to most other restaurants you're lucky to even get a 'happy birthday' out of them. Hickory's is a whole different story. She was given her own sign so everyone who came to the table knew, so every staff member who came to us acknowledged it. Food, drinks and service at the bar and table were all absolutely spot on. And to top it all off, she got invited behind the bar to make her very own milkshake with a very patient member of the bar team. Thank you to the lovely lady that waited on us and everyone else that made it so special. It absolutely made her day ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nVisited again today and were looked after by Josh. Thank you for being so welcoming and looking after us so well. Hickory's really are showing a lot of other restaurants that great food and great service really is still possible! We were sat in a lovely booth, next to the cinema. Kids had a blast. Can't wait to visit again! üòÉ",

Generally the service was good and one of our friends is gluten free and they were very happy with the choice of food on offer. Only improvements would be that I asked for a full fat coke and they brought Pepsi max (did replace with a bottle of coca cola after I mentioned this), there was a peice of plastic in the lettuce of my wife's fajitas and the waiter didn't bring cutlery so we had to ask for this after all the food was presented. Overall a good experience, food was cooked well and tasted great. We could see how busy the restaurant was, however service still seemed to be swift and we didn't find ourselves waiting for food / drinks too long at any point.",

Nice to see a venue with Children‚Äôs cutlery (a rarity these days) with kids packs on the table ready for use. Food was fresh and hot and portion sizes are American and big. Good luck to anyone wanting starter, main and desert. The only letdown for me was the milkshakes, as they‚Äôre more foamy than milkshakes. Anyone travelling with a baby be aware the family toilets upstairs don't have a baby change table. We found out after the baby change is downstairs but all the signs for the bathrooms are for upstairs.",

On arrival there was plenty of parking space and the lot was presently clean and no litter in sight. However, there seemed to be a great towed vehicle at the entrance which was probably from the attached Premier Inn next door.\n\nOn entering the venue, there was hand sanitizer available but no present information on the percentage of alcohol in the sanitizer. We were greeted fairly immediately but were told that our table was not available yet despite being on time and calling ahead. We were told to wait at the bar, for drinks and we would be told when our table would be ready 20 minutes passed and after seeing smaller parties being seated a member of staff (unknown role) told us that we would be compensated for the wait with a free round of drinks. Another 10 minutes passed and would be told that our seat is ready.\n\nThe venue was understandably busy due to Mother's Day. It was clear that the staff were very attentive to the guests but not to the floor space, there was some food debris on the floor that was not cleared up and was being kicked around by the kids running around.\n\nWe were told that a certain server would take care of us during our stay. Another server by another name was actually our acting server for the night. The drinks and popcorn was great from our experience and the food came very quickly. The quality of food was only slightly above average and for the price we had paid, it was justifiable.\n\nOverall, we left around 8:20 after waiting for the bill. The tipping system implied for the servers may be something other guests might need to look at. It is automatically added to the bill. The experience was good for the time and circumstances on the night. More could be done to improve the overall experience for me to fully recommend this place.\n\n6/10.",

We had to swap filthy glasses for clean ones off another table and remove an overflowing ceramic pot full of stinking cigarette ends to another table. Can‚Äôt think of any positives sorry. Won‚Äôt be going again!  Such a shame as it was a treat for my daughter‚Äôs birthday. If it crosses your mind to go here keep moving and think of somewhere else you‚Äôll be pleased you did unfortunately",

Safe to say I understand now why it‚Äôs always full! The drinks menu is so varied as it has a full bar, from beers, wine, gin, cocktails, milkshakes and non-alcoholic beverages. I had a peach iced tea, expecting a small glass (as most places provide when ordering a non-alcoholic drink), but when it came it was a huge mason jar - I was already impressed! When the mains came, the meat was so tender that my partner used a fork to simply slide the meat off of the rib, it was so juicy that he‚Äôs only set himself up for failure if he ever orders that from anywhere else. The desserts were insane too, very American-style fro-co (frozen custard) which blew my mind, and my partner had waffles (never seen him consume something so fast with the threat of me trying to steal some). Overall, the price and speed of service were perfect, I definitely will be visiting again.\nThe only negative for me as a vegetarian was the lack of choice for myself, however, it is a smokehouse and a meat haven, so I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to have much choice.",

The staff made us feel extra welcome from the second we couldn't even walk through the door quick enough without being welcomed. They even had a sign on our table taylored for us as it was our anniversary and each staff member that brought food and drinks, particular Emma who was our main waitress, made a point of it being our anniversary and joking with us through out the night. Food was mega, some of the best food we've ever experienced and not badly priced either for the experience and food and drink that you're getting. They even provided free glasses of prosecco for us and a \"mocktail\" on the house as we joked that my partner had a night shift to go to after the meal. Couldn't have had a better experience and will definitely return. Thanks",

The gluten free menu was reasonable, although slightly limited because mum doesn't do chilli at all, but we both opted for the pulled pork with beans. Wow! I must say it was the best surprise in a long time in terms of ambience, decor and food. The staff were on the ball about the gluten free side and we loved the ree popcorn and bottled water whilst we browsed the menu. It's not the cheapest out there, but it compares reasonably with others in Wilmslow and we will definitely be back!",

Not been cleaned, popcorn all over the floor. Went to sit at a booth near the bar and the stool table was broken to the point where if a drink was placed on it , it would be in your lap. Went to a third booth and then went to the 'washrooms'. They hadn't been cleaned either and stank. This is unforgivable in covid times. Got 1 drink each and looked at the menu. The prices were high end ¬£47 for a sharing platter ! No healthy options, mostly fried food. Another guy across the way complaining about how small the ribs he ordered . Decided to pay and leave.",

We've got a booking to come again this weekend for lunch!\n\nThe first time it was just the two of us a couple of weeks ago, we came around lunchtime when it was nice and quiet. We had two servers (I'm really sorry we can't remember your names now) A young lad who was new and in training and a lady who was shadowing/training him. They were both fantastic hosts, talked us through the many gins they have (over 40!) and had some good laughs and banter with! The food was served promptly and was delicious! (bbq chicken for my wife and the ribs for me) and the measures in the drinks also generous! Bless his heart the young lad even gave us a couple gin+lemonades on the house for being friendly and patient with him as we finished up to leave. We hope he's doing well!\n\nThe second time was Friday evening just gone, we came back with a close friend of ours who we haven't seen in over 18 months thanks to covid. It was a bit busier than before but that didn't hurt our service at all. This time we both went for the bird and beast burger and my goodness I don't think I've ever put something so delicious into my mouth before. Who'd have thought a hash brown would be the perfect accompaniment to a beef and chicken burger?\n\nOh and as a bonus, you get free fresh popcorn to nibble on while you wait! 10/10 would definitely recommend Hickory's and their staff to everyone. See you again soon team!",

The chef offerd us some tasters which we couldn't refuse and it really set the standard for what was coming out food wise.\nThe drinks came and I'm not a massive drinker but I could neck those cocktails all day long. The bartenders clearly know what there doing and it shows.\nBack onto food and it was just amazing again massive hats off to the chefs at this venue you guys really shocked me.\nOver all I'm very very impressed with the staff and venue. These guys tick every box that you expect to be ticked in hospitality venue and given they've had to endure months of restrictions it was really nice tk see the venue bouncing with happy customers. Myself and my partner will definitely be back and we will both recommend to anyone in the area who fancies some good food and cracking service.\nCheers guys :)",

They even had a little cinema room for the kids which i thought was a brilliant idea and they had shrek on, so the adults got a little peace. I would definitely recommend Hickorys Wilmslow and cannot wait to go back. I wish i could have taken more photos but it was difficult with everyone eating and it being so busy.
