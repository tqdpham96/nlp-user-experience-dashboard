Hannah then went about organising some of the celebs that were in that night to come and have their photo taken with my mum, which they obliged with full enthusiasm and kudos to these guys for taking the time out of their evening to blast a massive bolt of joy at my mum. The real stars though were Hannah and Molly who showed us real magic of human kindness. This is no ordinary place!",

Makes a change from the overpriced Wilmslow centre eateries. Fantastic value for money. Friendly and helpful staff. They even have monthly tribute band afternoons on a Wednesday for £13.50 including a meal. Not been to one yet but I'll be giving it a go. Well recommended 👍👍",

We have had steaks in the past and they were much thicker and much better quality and very good. The man who served us asked if we enjoyed the food, when we said no, he lost interest and walked away, which was disappointing. So sadly we will be avoiding the Unicorn in future.",

We felt as though as there weren’t many in and we were the only females the staff just wanted us to go. I thought if the place was open till 11pm then it was ok to order coffees and go to the toilet.

For people looking for a sports pub for a drink and a catch up, it might be alright. But unless there's a change in ownership or management we won't be returning and wouldn't recommend for a meal.\n\nOn arrival, there's plenty of parking, all tables are well spaced and there's an area for check-in (for COVID restrictions). After that not a single staff member wore any masks or visors. There was a single one-way sticker on the floor as you enter and no other directions regarding how to navigate through the building so was a bit of a free for all. There's plenty of choice on the menu and the prices look pretty reasonable. We ordered 6 meals, 4 different dishes and we waited for well over 90 minutes, probably because they only had a small number of waiting staff working. I had the Chick Pea Curry Banquet which was OK at best and the bhajis were undercooked with uncooked batter in them. The naan was hard in parts as though it was stale, other than that it was alright. Other people had Sunday roasts which they said the meat was dry and the majority was left. Inside the decor was dated and not in a quaint way.  The men's toilets were also extremely filthy and the smell was awful, it was clear they hadn't been cleaned in a while.  The atmosphere inside was definitely old pub style with sports on the TV and 90s music playing the whole time.",

Gammon and Eggs was also ordered with coffee. The Coffee was then included with the Burger deal and full price for the IPA was charged. A third separate burger deal was ordered with the Punk IPA - Greene King IPA was received. Once we had ordered we were not spoken to again and the only thanks we received was printed on the receipt that proved the devious way they charged extra.",

Punk IPA is not included in the burger deal, it is the Greene King IPA. When ordering a meal deal, the cheapest drink will be included as the deal. If a pint of IPA is ordered alongside a coffee in a meal deal the coffee will be discounted. The above is company and till process and not something the team have control over. It is also clearly outlined in the terms which are available on the menu. We are more than willing to discuss this further so if you would like to contact the pub on 01625528351 asking for a duty manager then please feel free to do so.",
