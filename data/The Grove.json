If you would like a quieter experience and more traditional food try our lunch menu complimented by our relaxing jazz music. Our day time lunch experience is very different to the evening entertainment. As for slow service, we will definitely have a chat with the staff regarding this, as regardless of the day/time service is our priority. We hope you try us again.",

Eggs were tiny and stone cold, one piece of small sourdough and barely cooked bacon. My husbands breakfast was nice but my daughters pancakes were forgotten about until we mentioned it again.\nWouldn‚Äôt mind but it was literally only us in there. Our waiter was nice but did seem new and like he‚Äôd been left without knowing what he was doing. Would probably visit again for a drink but would probably give the breakfast a miss",

                "text": "I'm going to preface this very short review by saying I've been going to the Grove for a few years now, and it's genuinely a nicely decorated place, with lovely staff and nice beers. If you fancy a drink and you're in Wilmslow, you can't go wrong. I'd ordered food there a few times before, and it was really the only criticism I could make about the place - it's all pretty overpriced and just sort of...OK.\n\nI went recently and saw that they'd updated their menu - so I thought I'd give it another go and see if anything had improved. Our very nice waitress informed me that the pie of the day was chicken and leek.\n\nAt this point of the thesis, we should take a brief tangent and discuss the meaning of \"X of the day\" and how it applies to food, because I think there are perhaps numerous schools of thought here. My personal understanding of 'pie of the day' was that it was a pie, made *on the day*, of a specific flavour (with the flavour changing on other days of the week). Now, I was, as you will read, probably very wrong about this assumption. I might even be wrong about the definition of 'of the day'. But if you went to a seafood restaurant and got the 'catch of the day', what does that mean? It's been caught that day, right? Well, based on my understanding of the term, I ordered the pie of the day. What further convinced me was the fact that it was just shy of ¬£15. I mean, ¬£15 must be a good pie, right? Anyway, let's move on.\n\nSo, the pie (of the day) arrived, and my heart dropped. I thought I'd be getting a slice of delicious pie, but what I saw on the plate was in all likelihood, an inverted Holland's pie, barely visible above the sea of gravy it was floating in. There was also some mash in there somewhere, which in this analogy, was akin to a murky seabed.\n\nThe pie itself was OK. It was a small individual pie, like any you'd find in a shop (for ¬£2.50). The only compliment I could give on the pie was that it wasn't burnt and was successfully defrosted.\n\nThe mash was another matter completely. I was actually given the option of chips or mash, and FOOL that I was, I chose mash. The allure of nice fluffy mash with a pie is just too much, but what I received could be mistaken for wallpaper paste. Gluey and bland. I'm 95% sure it wasn't mashed at all, but whipped (over whipping potatoes causes this exact sort of consistency).\n\nThe final culprit in the assault on my tastebuds was the gravy. I realise that the reader might think I'm being over dramatic at this point in the dissertation, but I'm not joking, the thing was *swimming* in gravy. I know we're northern up here so gravy runs in our veins, but seriously, the mash had partly disintegrated in the gravy to form some kind of ungodly science experiment on my plate. It wouldn't have even been that bad if the gravy tasted like...y'know, gravy. But no, it tasted like vaguely meat-flavoured salt water.\n\nSo, to conclude my OTT internet rant, the pie wasn't very good, but I will attempt to be constructive and offer some points to the Grove, which is doing pretty much everything else right.\n\n1. Don't charge ¬£15 for something if it's going in the microwave or is bought frozen - you're not a fine dining restaurant, I get it, but c'mon guys, ¬£15?! What's the profit margin on those things, 500%?\n2. Maybe don't call it pie of the day? I realise this could be me misinterpreting what this actually means to be fair\n3. Calm down a tad with the gravy. I love gravy but it's excessive - maybe offer it in a wee boat next to the plate?\n4. Whatever you're doing with the mash, just stop doing it. Please. Try something else.\n\nTL;DR pie sucked, beer good. 3 stars.",

This performance was piss poor.\n\nOur order wasn‚Äôt complex and it wasn‚Äôt demanding. 2 steak sandwiches a portion of chips and a kids brunch.\n\nI‚Äôve been racking my brains, to try and think about who I have managed within the industry that would potentially hate me so much they would serve me what we received.\n\nThe steak in the sandwich was dry, overcooked and rubbery, there was not any sauce or moisture of any kind and the whole dish was unbalanced. At ¬£14 each, you would expected at least edible, hopefully nice, ideally delicious. This didn‚Äôt meet any of those benchmarks.\n\nThe chips were ok. Just overcooked. Triple cooked chips have been the rage for a while, but I think these guys have tried to do a Gillette, where they add another razor. Quadruple cooked chips (if that‚Äôs what they are) just taste burnt.\n\nFor the kids brunch we ordered sausage beans and scrambled egg. The sausage was decent the beans were good, the scrambled egg was an omelette. Very disappointing. Our two year old human dustbin drew the line at rubbery eggs.\n\nI made the mistake of paying after ordering and before the food arrived. After the food was delivered to the table we did not see another member of staff. Begrudgingly we are the sandwiches. My wife is 7 months pregnant and her blood sugar was all over the place. I was just hungry and wanted to get out of there. I could eat anything if I had to and this was definitely closer to having to than wanting to.\n\nMy wife summed it up best as when we were leaving she said ‚Äúwe should have gone to Greggs‚Äù.\n\nI was so angry and disappointed I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to make a scene. We won‚Äôt be returning.",

The audacity to deny entry to someone for wearing a particular brand, whilst other punters continued to waltz in and out of the premises in flip flops and other egregious forms of fashion baffles me. Such draconian, hypocritical and quite frankly elitist behaviour has sadly left a very sour proverbial taste in my mouth which would very much deter me from returning to the establishment\nor recommending it to anyone within my social circle. I'd encourage you to reconsider your current security contract and look for a supplier with the commercial sense to not turn away lucrative business.",

The manager was unhelpful and again instead of apologising for the situation made our whole table of 4 feel uncomfortable, he was very outspoken that he believed his member of staff over the 4 of us on the table and i felt as though the whole experience was very unprofessional, we came out for a nice drink for the first time after lockdown and i feel as though a clear mistake could have been handled in a much nicer way.",
