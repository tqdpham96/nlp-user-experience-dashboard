The 3 bouncers then proceeded to drag him up and all 3 had hold of him dragging him out. Which has resulted in bruising under his arm from where he was being held by a bouncer. I was sober at the time and my partner was not putting up a fight and was not reluctant when he was being escorted out. It did not need all 3 bouncers to forcibly remove him. It felt as if they were all removing him for the fun of it. I asked what they were doing and they told me to leave them to it. I explained I was with him. I felt there was a lack of care and respect from them and I’m really disappointed in how it was all handled, it was quite distressing to watch. I understand they have a duty of care to those who use the bar, however my partner was not abusive or non-compliant and no care was shown to the both of us. This experience has now made me very uncomfortable and I do not feel safe going out!\n\nI have already written an email complaint on Sunday and I have had no response.",

Any incident of this nature is extremely serious and required the DS to unlock the door and gain access due to a lack of reply. In this situation we must act fast and expect the worst as I am sure you will understand. I apologise if you feel this was not required but as you are aware he is under our duty of care whilst in the venue. \n\nDoor staff then got him to his feet and walked him to the front door and provided him with a complimentary bottle of water. After reviewing the footage myself I can see he held up and gently walked to the front door.\n\nI apologise if you feel the door staff's reply was short or lacked patience. With the venue being so busy on NYE it is important that they resolve issues promptly so they can return to their set locations and oversee the venue to spot any other potential issues or dangers.\n\nI hope you can give us another chance to regain your trust and join the many hundreds who join us every week to enjoy drinks and food in a fun and safe environment.\n\nIf you wish to discuss this any further please don't hesitate to get in touch\n\nKind Regards,\nMatthew Hodges\nGeneral Manager\n\n\n",

The presentation of the food is possibly also damaged / ruined in transit\n\nPlease contact Deliveroo as I am sure they will process you a full refund on this order, the delay on collection and delivery will be on their records\n\nKind Regards,\nMatthew Hodges\nGeneral Manager",

While we appreciate you are unhappy at the way you feel you were treated we must make it clear that both Revolution Bars Group and the Door Supervisor teams we employee are bound by a duty of care to monitor and prevent intoxicated guests from access to more alcohol. On this occasion it was deemed that you were too intoxicated to enter the venue.

Unfortunately we do have to remove the seating around the bar as we approach the late night hours, as they do pose a potential hazard.  There is plenty of seating available throughout the venue should you wish to stay seated though, and perhaps next time we could show you to a table.  We hope to see you again soon.

Mostly due to the great bar staff who are all friendly, smiley, and generous. One even gave me a cigarette when i had run out and you know how bad the craving is when THAT happens lol, although i really like the decor as well. It is now my favourite bar in Wilmslow. At lunchtimes and after work on a Friday anyway ;) I look forward to my next visit where i am assured that around 8pm on Fridays when the women get particularly hot!",
