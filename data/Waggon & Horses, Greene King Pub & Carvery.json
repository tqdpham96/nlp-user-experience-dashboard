Luckily found the QR code for ordering online, as we were completely ignored once we sat down. Went to bar to order drinks, and did food via the QR. Final order of dessert took half an hour to arrive. It's obviously a \"cheap and cheerful\", rather than quality pub, and the value was good, but the service really was shocking. We won't be back.",

I do not have voicemail activated on my account.\nAnyway, we decided carvery would be fine for us all.\nIn the end, we discovered the process for getting our carvery through trial and error, as the staff gave us no information.\nThere were no Yorkshire puddings available - when we asked, we were shown a tray of burnt puddings on a shelf as if that explained it...  The peas were so bad that most of our party left them on the plate.\nSaving graces were that the meat was tasty and the roast potatoes surprisingly ok.\nBy 8.20, staff were clearly packing away and all ready to close the restaurant and we felt uncomfortable staying any longer so did not attempt to get any dessert (which we presumed would be unavilable anyway) and headed off to somewhere more welcoming for our coffees.\nWe won't be returning...",

Theres hundreds of flies in the wall lights above tables definitely not been cleaned in last few years. Feet stick to carpet. Very dirty pub. Needs new make over. And new staff. Stood at carvery and bar when empty for over 15 minutes. Not good for the area. Owners should sell up or do the right thing and bring it to modern times. Pub belongs in 1970s",

I sent my husband to collect providing him with the whole information that he needs to collect the meal. As I stayed at home with my 9 months old unwell baby. Once he arrived to collect he had been told that they can't give him the bags, as they have to \"see\" the app, and to see thaf he is \"swiping to collect\" the order. He explained the situation, and even told them that I can do it this from home and send a screen shot as a proof. They still refused to give him the bags. I didn't read anywhere saying this, and if you didn't show to the staff the app, you will not be given the food???? Ridiculous!!! Hoping to save myself a time from cooking, as my both kids are unwell. So I told myself I can not cook today and can try the food from there. And if we like, we can go regularly for meals, as is not too far from us. But after this behaviour and attitude I'm not thinking to give them a shot.",

The chicken wasn't much better, but the gammon was better, and pretty tasty. The veg were all tasty and well cooked. The only negative side was the locals who were making continuous comments to me and the missus, although they were  pretty harmless, it's not what you want when you're trying to eat your Sunday lunch!",

Even though we mentioned that we'll take the food away when we've been asked about table number, we found the food on plates when we've been called to go and collect it. We then reminded them that we'll take the food away and then one of the staff went to bring me take away boxes. After waiting 10 minutes for the boxes, they said that there are none left and I'll have to eat at the pub even though my family and friends are at the play area where they advertise their food. Most of the staff there including the manager are lacking professionalism.\nThey will definitely need a retraining or maybe even changing.\nYou can't be happy with the service you receive there unless you're completely drunk",

We are relatively new customers and I’m so happy with the food and service, that I will be making sure my son comes here for his healthy hearty lunch to carry him through his busy afternoon of play.\n\nLisa has been especially nice and welcoming. She is extremely patient on the phone and really helpful answering any questions even though you can hear how busy it is in the background she has been very nice and explaining things and not in a rushed or impatient way as to get you off the phone. So thank you for this Lisa it makes the world of difference to know that your needs are cared for.\n\nMy son has additional and complex needs and this place has very good experience with young people and adults whom I believe return there on a regular basis and I believe they always try to cater for this as far as trying to make sure that you have your same seating each week. Although I do understand that ...if you don’t book ...this might not always be possible as other people will be dining too.\n\nI have been sent photos of my son tucking into his hearty food with beautiful looking vegetables and even down to the sauce included dishes have been served on a separate dish! This is 5*****s for me because to know how important this can be to somebody with additional needs means so much to my heart to know how important that is and to put this into place just means the world to me that our children’s and adults needs are really taken care of and that they understand and more to the point “care” So huge thank you for this everyone xx\n\nThere is also a slush machine that works very well as a “special surprise/treat/reward” or bribe lol for good behaviour 😉\n\nWe will be a regular from now even though we live miles away, you can’t beat the service and friendliness and good food that you get here 😁\n\nBrilliant well done and keep up the fabulous work xx",

We were extremely dissatisfied and wasn’t as my friends had described. The food was undercooked and cold in the middle not cooked to a great standard. We could hear members of staff swearing while standing around chatting to each other with inappropriate content not what I would like my family to have to sit and listen to while trying to enjoy what could be our last meal out together for a while. We were made to social distance in the restaurant however I observed several men sitting together in the bar area surely they all do not live in the same household? They were not made to sign in at the door and just walked straight in!!! No care for breaking the law! I observed a member of staff signing the toilet tick chart to say it had been cleaned however they didn’t step foot in the toilets just ticked the box and off they went. We are in a pandemic and these types of things are important to make people feel safe in your establishment. The carpet where we were seated was dirty with what looked like slug trails. Disgusting!! I will not be returning and would have complained to a manager however I felt it would have been a waste of time.",

I live miles away but I'll definitely be back for another carvery. Also portions of meat on the carvery were massive and food was really well priced if pay double for the carvery it was that good. My Mrs had a steak and she also said she can't remember last time she had a meal this good.staff were really friendly and helpful. Would of gave ten stars but will only allow 5.",

The service was good and nothing was to much trouble. The food was lovely and you can choose between the carvery or off the menu. Food came when we wanted it rather than when they wanted to give it to us witch worked great with the kids in and out of the play area. Just to say i had the mixed grill and it was spot on. All in all it was a great experience would definitely recommend. Thanks for making are 60th birthday party really good. 🥳🎂🍰🍾🤪",

Meat on the day was turkey, Gammon, & beef. All cooked well. Would recommend the carvery. Suitable for all ages.  There is a wacky warehouse next door for before or after the meal suitable for young children & babies.",

And when we came nobody asked me if the no of children coming has changed!!!  2 kids didn't show up, 1 of which I knew about and if I knew that I could still change the no of children to pay less I definitely would have!

The chef carves the meat for you, a choice of turkey, ham or beef,you could choose all three. The veg is pipping hot, and such a great selection.\nYou have a choice of witch size plate you would like. Small, medium or large. You could also up grade for an extra £ . This gives you an extra Yorkshire pudding and 2 pigs in the blanket. You don't really need this as Yorkshire pudding is included in the first place.\nWe was a party of 4 adults. One of our group is bad on her legs and needs the use of the disabled toilets. The lady who looked after us was amazing and very friendly. \"Her name was Danielle\" hope she will read this and get the pat on the back she deserves. Thank you to the whole team. We will be returning soon.",

Gold standard, i do eat out alot and will certainly praise any restaurant where praise is due and will also critique somewhere if i am not happy.\nSo well done to all the staff at this facility im sure the manager/land lady is very proud.\nHappy xmas and thank you for making our day that bit more special once again.\nReally appreciated customers and thanks for our xmas card that was a lovely touch.",
