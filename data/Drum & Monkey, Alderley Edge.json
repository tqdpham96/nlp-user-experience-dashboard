Was so excited to see the ladies I used to work with & didn't want to spoil the mood, although everyone remarked how much I was struggling to eat this tough pastry.  A gesture of something would have much appreciated.",

I've had a few trial shifts in my time probably lasting 3 hours maximum. Head chef even wanted me to stay longer. How do you justify a 6 hour trial shift and not even here back. I wasn't bothered about not getting the job when the head chef says you will be the first to know and don't hear nothing, well he panicked to much anyway. Can't give you a compliment on the food as I didn't try any. What can I say",

A 19yr old boy was doing the cooking who wasn't a chef & the waitress was in tears & said it was a shambles. Our steaks were not cooked as we ordered them & had to go back - when they were brought back parts of the meal were missing & the sauce had not been re done. We ordered puddings and were told they weren't available. Another customer burnt her hand on jug holding custard it was so hot and the first aid kit was virtually none existent. Health and safety should definitely take a look at this place.",
