Starters if prawn cocktail with salmon had too much lettuce not enough fish  mains took a long time to get there & the carrots were solid, the parsnips very soft, meat was fatty, 8 small potatoes were not roasted, sprouts were tiny, cabbage was crunchy. Xmas pud had very little brandy sauce .All in all not a good meal. Staff were friendly . Toilets are at the end of a safari upstairs, long walk & climb for me. Will not rush back.",

I will pass your comments over to our kitchen team and look into what went wrong during your visit, as this isn't the standard we pride ourselves in offering. If you'd like to discuss this further please do call us on 01625526511. We really hope we get the opportunity to turn this around.

Have to say that the food was excellent as was the atmosphere, lots of people eating. The service was great although our waitress referred to my wife and I as “Guys and my lovelies” terms that I can’t stand. The reason why I have given 4 stars is because of the darkness of the car park. Why, oh why isn’t the entrance, from the road, not illuminated?? Then there are lights along the paths from the car park to the door of the pub but, guess what, most of them are out, they are in darkness. Come on Honey Bee, it’s winter, it’s dark, light the outside space up.",

We found The Honey Bee and decided to try it.\n\nIt's a lovely looking place from the outside, decent parking and we were welcomed and seated quickly. The person serving us was friendly and informative. That's when it started to go down hill, we ordered our drinks and meals and had waited around 15 mins when they came out to tell us they hadn't got one of our starters and could they swap? A little annoying and definitely not as nice as the starter we had ordered. After they'd cleared our plates we then waited for another 15 minutes when the person serving came out to say they hadn't got one of the mains either. So we had to swap another meal. When we received our meals mine had been clearly waiting for my wife's to be cooked as mine was barely warm and hers was red hot. I didn't mention anything as we really just wanted to get out at this point. We paid £80 for 2 starters and 2 mains and 4 drinks. We had to pay full price for all the items that we didn't really want and they even gave is someone else's bill at the end. No apology as such.\n\nOverall the staff are friendly and the place was welcoming and clean but I expected more on a Friday night in a busy area.\n\nWe will try another Vintage Inn soon and hopefully find somewhere as good as the Hartshead.",

Nearly £17 for Mash and Sausages must be a new one in the North West! The service isn't always great, I feel the staff are definitely underpaid. You can't charge premium money and not give a premium service. The food is hit and miss, some dishes are nice and others aren't great... Its definitely not worth the price. I definitely think you'd improve things by paying a better hourly rate and attracting better staff. Staff aren't knowledgeable about things on the menu and when asking for extras if there's not a manager about and they are unsure they make some excuse up. Its just not a premium brand... Shame really. Prices are creeping to miller and carter prices but by far a much poorer experience in comparison....\n\nPay peanuts, get monkeys",

Everyone commented on how delicious the meat was. 3 of us had dessert. Eton mess was heavenly. So light but also indulgent. One of us had sticky toffee pudding and loved it. Even the toilets upstairs are lovely with a view of the front garden and lots of mirrors. Not expensive and we can't wait to come back. Thank you for having us xxx",

There is hardly any choice, and why is it a meat eating person who has lasagne gets the choice of chips or salad, but a vegetarian having a veggie lasagne only has the option to have salad, and chips have to be paid for as an extra. The veggie lasagne looked like grey slime, really not appetising at all. We had some cheese starter things, they were disgusting, just cold soggy cheese, and one of them didn't even have any cheese in, just an empty parcel thing. We couldn't eat it, and so tried the mushrooms instead, they were certainly piping hot (bubbling hot), and quite nice, but the toast that came with them was only toasted on one side.   When I made my complaint on the lasagne, I was asked if I would like anything else, but there was no other vegetarian option, so I said it's fine I will just eat the chips, the manageress then had the cheek as she walked away to say \"enjoy your food\" What!! A plate of chips!!\nI certainly won't be going back.",

We had a lovely bottle of wine too. Lovely atmosphere with great staff and good food and they accept dogs. Couldn't ask for more!",

We then had out mains but had to wait for more cutlery before we could start eating.\n\nThe mains - two of use ordered the Sunday trio and one ordered the beef in chianti .  The beef was  advertised that it came with tender stem broccoli however normal broccoli was served.  All the veg was overcook and seemed waterlogged (similar to frozen veg), the roast potatoes were closer to boiled potatoes, no where near roasted!.   All the food on the Sunday Trio's was cold! Beef stew was hot though.\nThe cauliflower cheese was lacking the cheese sauce, it seemed like it was over cooked cauliflower with a sprinkling of cheese on top.\n\nAll in all it was a very disappointing experience from the service to the quality of the food.",

So first impressions, yes nice place in nice grounds, Inside very pleasant, Now I do not wish to be too hard here, but 2 pints a glass of wine and a small coke from the pump, £18.00!  we ordered our meals and a few starters, well 5 prawns and 2 scollops and a little drizzled sauce not value for money, so main orders came served by very young staff! apparently the pub has recently been taken over very recently, however take over any business and you need to be hitting the ground running, I ordered rack of lamb! 3 very thin lamb chops luke warm, mange tout luke warm, small jug of gravy cold, also a small put vessel like a shepperds pie, so hot I was surprised It was supposed to have toasted bread! none came so it was requested that it had not been put with the meal, the waited said it did not come with it! My wife showed him the menue and clearly stated it did, so I ate my luke warm food finished it as we had waited long enough and did not want to wait to have a it microwaved! the the waiter brought out a bread batton, not toasted and no butter! out of 6 meals the 7 yr old only had the garlic bread and left what seemed like a full tin of pease in a pot bowl, and the fish,  4 out of 6 meals were not acceptable.  Two were rib eye steak, these were very fatty and quite a lot was left as fatty, for a cut of steak that is supposed to be the better part of the animal, left was 30 to 50%? and £44.00 for two steak dinners !!!!  Now I am not saying I will not eat there again, but maybe ill stick to Deckers at Sale Water Park.  first impressions do last and my son took us there with his children, as he had eaten there before it was taken over. why take us there, because then it was in his words a lovely meal and service. My son did make it known to the new landlord, and I do hope it improves. I think next week I will invite my son and his partner to my home and I will cook a Lamb Kalleftico.",

We join our party after they come and find us and say what are you doing sat here…. The food omg if your paying this price for this rubbish microwave processed food you need your head testing. Never returning ourselves heard it was a good place to go and they were busy but believe me when you eat out a-lot you quickly realise how poor this place is and the food quality is that of weather-spoons quality . We are so grateful that our company and gathering made the evening and never will we return to be overcharged for frozen food. We worked out the bill as they were unable to split it and found a service charge of £26 which i refused to pay given cutlery was placed on the table in a pile sort yourself out and staff are serving drinks and food over peoples heads rather than walking round. Clearly not trained and not there fault as they haven’t been taught I’ve given one star but really worthy of none.  No training, food is appalling people that go here really haven’t experienced the finer side of dinning for the same price and in some cases cheaper. We can eat at 5star for less money and better quality food and service. If you want weatherspoons food at afluente prices then this is the place to get ripped off….",

For main we ordered a meat feast pizza and a signature burger. My first issue was the fact you get 3 chicken wings. I understand the point of it being a starter but £6.50 for this felt very steep - given so little amount. The other starter issue was the fact the king prawns were not king prawns and instead lots of standard prawns, which my partner was not so pleased with. The burger they had was average. The pizza was asked to have no chutney and it came with it on. I asked for this to be changed, but by the time it came, my partner had finished their burger. Which meant I had to awkwardly eat while they had finished. Finally their seemed to be an issue with the soft drinks, it was very flat and after it being changed it was still the same so I just made do with it. Other people also mentioned this so I'm not sure what the issue with soft drinks was. Over all I felt slightly let down with the whole visit, given that we paid just shy of £50 for 2 courses and a drink each.",

We ordered the chicken sandwich and I had the fish finger sandwich with a portion of onion rings on the side.  The food did take a while to come which I don't mind as I'm assuming it's cooked fresh to order.  The fish fingers were mainly batter. I couldn't see hardly any fish inside and what I could see was grey. It was very dry as it was in ciabatta which had a lot of flour underneath.  The chips were nice but the onion rings were incredibly greasy....yuk! Felt disappointed.  My partner thought the chicken sandwich was okay.\nImprovements are needed for sure.",

Staff were friendly and the place was cosy and quaint, a lovely venue.\n\nMaybe the kitchen wasnt ready or they were short staffed, as we, 7 of us, were the first table there, but it took almost 40 minutes for our food to arrive. Unfortunately, my poached eggs for my eggs florentine came hard boiled, so had to wait longer for them to remake them, but it was good once corrected, it was surprising as 3 others ordered eggs benedict and came out lovely and runny.\n\nNot too sure why the Eggs Florentine was 30p more expensive than Eggs Benedict, when the only difference is it's spinach (menu says buttered spinach but it was just wilted spinach) instead of ham 🤷‍♂️",

I'm very sorry to hear you didn't have a 5 star experience with us.\n\nUnfortunately on Sundays our menu is slightly reduced to incorporate our Sunday roast's, this meaning we only offer to rib eye steak on Sundays as we don't sell the sirloin on these days.\n\nRegarding our cask range, we do only offer doom bar on our drinks menu which was on yesterday, we have recently been trying a few different cask ales which we will continue to do in the future, however, this week we didn't manage to get any others in.\n\nAgain, I'm very sorry to hear you were disappointed with your visit with us and but i do hope to see you again in the future.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nThe Honey Bee team.",

I soon realised why.. the prawns were so tiny and overcooked and probably about 8 of them and the scallops were the size of maybe a 20p piece and there was 2 of them.. this was £9.50 I couldn't believe it, I ordered gammon for my main to which I was told they don't serve with pineapple just with eggs & triple cooked chips... the gammon was really really salty, I know gammon is very salty anyway but this was overkill, the yolks of the eggs were like bullets and the \"triple\" cooked chips looked like they hadn't even been properly cooked once they were anaemic, so so disappointing, I did tell the waitress when she asked if everything was satisfactory to which she apologised and offered a complimentary desert, what I actually wanted was another main as this trip cost me & my partner £72 and I was still hungry, I declined it.\nStandards and quality have really slipped.. what a shame...",

When I asked if they could give me a couple of more veggie options I was told they could do me the burger or ‘a roast without the meat’ - so a plate of side veg for my main meal, erm no thanks! Went with the only option of the burger which was distinctly average. Husband says his trio of roast (which was actually only a due as they had also ran out of turkey) was also average. Overpriced for what you get. Won’t be back.",

We had technical issues with our kitchen extraction system which prevented us from opening the kitchen in a safe and legal way. I really do understand your disappointment, it was the last thing we wanted to do especially on such a special day. Please accept my apologies once again, if you wish to speak to myself further please contact me on 01625526511.\n\nKindest Regards\nThe Honey Bee",

As it’s valentines weekend we pre booked ahead of our visit, we arrived slightly  ahead of time and we were escorted to our table.\nThe pub is very cozy, it has real log burning fires which were lit! Perfect for a rainy cold Day in the uk.\nI had the serloin of beef Sunday roast and mum had the trio of roasts, with a side of mash. The portion size is very generous and the food was delicious. Would highly recommend especially if you are visiting or living  around the area. It is a great location about 10 minutes drive from Manchester airport.",

On arrival the car park was full with people parking on verges,  we had to queue to go in as it was very busy.  Some of the starters ordered were not what was listed on the menu so we had to send back. The mains were not good as we had to request vegetables that were hot as the ones we were served were cold. Also my geandsons burger was served with salad on the bun so he refused to eat it. We had requested no salad but this was not adhered to. The manager did apologise but did not offer any incentive for us to carry on our meal and order desserts. We asked for the birthday cake paid the bill and left.  We did make several complaints during the meal when we could get someones attention. The restaurant was over subscribed and under staffed. Will not be going back in a hurry.",

The man behind the bar asked us if we had a table booked. I said yes. He then abruptly said \" stand back over there \" as though I was in the way. We eventually got seated and ordered our food.\n\nIt was very disappointing. The cut of meat I had was poor and full of Grissel and the roast potatoes weren't even roasted properly. They were quite hard and a bit oily. We didn't even bother with the desert menu.\n\nWhen it came time to pay, I walked up to the bar and I used my card. The lady who took my payment didn't smile, say thank you or see you again or anything. Just took my payment and walked off!\n\nFirst and last time I will be going there.",

Service attentive and courteous but best of all the staff really took great precautions around my gluten allergy - sounds daft but you'd be surprised how many places don't understand it. Our server even questioned and went to double check the fruit crumble ingredients despite it being listed on the allergy information as ok. Top marks!!! Thank you :)",

As I booked with phone track and trace was automatically done. 2 car parks to rear and outdoor tables in garden. Beautiful, large stylish pub with a mixture of old + new decor with a cosy relaxing ambience. Lots of little nooks and cranny seating areas which I think gives it chatacter. Toilets upstairs but assume they have disabled on ground floor but not sure.  Hand gel on entrance + throughout pub. Staff ask you to use hand gel before allowing you in the pub, which is good, then explain that you wear your masks at all times walking around pub(to + from table entering + leaving premises + to + from toilet) once seated you can remove mask. Staff take you to your table and it is all table service. All staff wore masks at all times, kept a good safe distance from you, polite, professional and friendly. Cleaned tables as soon as customers left. Good menu choice for meat eaters but not as big a choice for veggies. I'm not a true veggie as I eat fish now + then if the veggie options aren't to my likening. Hubby & I  both had fish gougion sandwich which come with a choice of chunky chips or fries, fish in a light batter with a little tartar sauce already on bread but no garnish on sandwich or plate but that didn't matter. Delicious and quite filling. The mini puds menu was just enough for me but you only get 3 choices from main menu with a cup of coffee, so I had the pud(choccie brownie + ice cream, rich + yummy) + hubby had the coffee. Would definitely recommend.",

My daughter had to collect them from a tray on the bar!!!.our food order was taken from a very helpful waitress,nearly 50 minutes !! LATER  our food was brought to us ,two Sunday roasts were almost cold and one Wagyu burger was presented with an additive that was specifically! NOT asked to be included.I approached the manager and voiced my disappointment,he told me that there would be no charge for any of the meals and apologised,fair enough,however ,this does not really compensate  for the ruined evening,if seven meals cannot be presented without a significant delay ,and without  two being unfit to eat,then perhaps you should only take bookings for 4 or less.the waitress was not at fault.",

Waited to be reseated and the staff member didnt return. Hence forth we will not be returning.

Unfortunately the honey bee management only permit eating outside if you are at a glass topped table, this does mean a short wait until one becomes available on busier summer days. The fish and triple cooked chips are excellent! Just a stones throw away from Manchester International Airport so if you tie it in with a trip to an airport viewing park the kids are sure to have an excellent day out! Great selection of beer and wine too!",

However the Turkey and spuds were lovely the rest I cud leave and the staff could not cope as it was relatively busy. Received the food before I had my cutlery. Wasn't asked how my meal was, or if we needed anything. No condiments to make it taste better. Gravy arrived after I had eaten most of the meal.  Yorkshire pudding so hard it would make a great weapon.",

We arrived in time, then were kept waiting for an hour and 40 minutes before the manager gave up and sat us at a high table on stools near the toilets that had previously been a waiting area.\n\nOverall the food was good but the roast turkey was not. It was poorly seasoned and used instant gravy.  We had no condiments to season it ourselves.  The rest of the food was excellent.\n\nThe bar does not stock any interesting craft beers as this is a typical chain pub. The beer they did have was well kept as there are a cask marquis monitored pub.\n\nThe décor and atmosphere of this place is excellent with a large outdoor seating area. The carpark did not have enough spaces when we went, but this may not be typical as it was Christmas day.\n\nThe manager, who does not usually work there, could not be faulted, he was extremely apologetic, bringing us free drinks and then refunding us the cost of the meal. As a result of this the star rating it's based on the quality of the food and beer we had.",
